<p>So, yesterday I was treated to what I like to call the Basic Evangelical Tithing Sermon, or BETS.   You’ve probably heard it yourself a few times, if you’ve moved in evangelical circles.  Many churches will trot it out once a year or so.   It tends to annoy me, because it tends to conflate a quite reasonable review of the church’s financial situation with a bundle of guilt and some really bad hermeneutics.</p>
<p>I was going to write an angry point-by-point refutation of the BETS, but a cooler head than mine suggested otherwise.</p>
<p>So instead, a brief thought on the subject of tithes.<br />
<a href="/images/2012/03/IMG_00000017.jpg"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-470 alignright" height="196" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" src="/images/2012/03/IMG_00000017-1024x575.jpg" srcset="/images/2012/03/IMG_00000017-1024x575.jpg 1024w, /images/2012/03/IMG_00000017-300x168.jpg 300w" title="IMG_00000017" width="350" /></a><br />
If we’re going to talk about tithing, then we can’t really avoid <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%2014&amp;version=MSG">Deutronomy Chapter 14</a>, where the Israelites are instructed by their God that it was their sacred duty to have the mother of all barbecues every year.</p>
<p>I’m serious. Go <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%2014&amp;version=MSG">read</a> it.</p>
<p>It’s a fascinating chapter.  The first third is all about the importance of finding a good Kosher supermarket in your neighbourhood.  The last paragraph is about how it’s a good idea to take care of those on the edge of society: the immigrant, the orphan, the single parent.   And in the middle section of the chapter the Israelites are explicitly commanded to to spend one tenth of their yearly incoming on “cattle, sheep, wine or beer” or anything else that they liked, and eating together in one big annual party.</p>
<p>A tenth of your household income.  Maybe 5 or 6 thousand dollars for a typical Canadian family.  On a barbecue. That’s a lot of steak and Molsons!  And this isn’t just a backyard get-together, the entire country was supposed to get in on this.  It makes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_Man">Burning Man</a> sound kinda tame.</p>
<p>Apparently, when God talks about tithing, he talks about barbecues.</p>

                <h2><a href="/2012/03/02/church-23-collier-st-united/">Church 23 – Collier St. United</a></h2>
                
                
                <div class="entry-content">

                    
        
<p>Collier St. United is another of our larger downtown churches, steps away from the bar and shopping district on Dunlop street.</p>
<p>Unlike <a href="http://renaissancenow.ca/2011/09/11/church-2-painswick-united/" title="Church 2 – Painswick United">Painswick</a> United, a small congregation meeting in a strip-mall, Collier Street has a large facility that it uses to the max.   The main sanctuary on Sunday was packed, and the balcony was mostly full too.</p>
<p>Collier Street strikes me as a very ‘involved’ church.  During the service, an ‘Installation of Officials’ was held; a recognition and commissioning of those serving the church in various capacities this year.  25 or 30 people came to the front for this part of the service. In fact, there’s clearly tons of activity going on here.  There were 60 or so events listed for this week alone on the handout sheet, and judging by the announcements, the church website, and the various bulletin boards around the building, Collier Street should win the award for ‘Church in Barrie with the Most Programs.’</p>
<p>The service itself followed a typical format; songs, announcements, performances by two different choirs, and a sermon.  Interestingly, although the topic of the sermon was Christ’s passion, the Rev. Dennis Posno chose to talk about Jesus’ life, not death, about Jesus’ passion for peace, for hope, for justice and for healing.</p>
<p>Collier Street is clearly a tight knit community, and like some other similar churches, it can be very easy for a visitor to be aware of their status as an outsider.   At First Christian Reformed, 4 or 5 people introduced themselves to me and welcomed me to the service before it had even started.  At Collier Street no-one really noticed my presence, despite the convivial atmosphere at coffee hour.  This is a tricky balance for any church to strike, between nurturing its existing community and being open and welcoming to outsiders.  But that said, I think if someone did take the time and effort to get involved, they would find it a warm and accepting community.</p>

                <h2><a href="/2012/03/02/francis-bacon/">Francis Bacon</a></h2>
                
                
                <div class="entry-content">

                    
        
<p>If we are going to discuss modernism and postmodernism, then we should really also briefly cover pre-modernism. If  the postmodernist looks to their social network for authority, and the modernist looks to the expert, then the pre-modernist looks to the hierarchy.</p>
<p>The dramatic shift from pre-modern to modern thought has it’s roots, I think, in the Enlightenment. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon">Francis Bacon</a> (friend of Queen Elizabeth I and King James I, Attorney General, Lord Chancellor, lawyer, philosopher, author, scientist, and all-round overachiever), started his book “<a href="http://www.constitution.org/bacon/nov_org.htm">Novum Organum</a>” with the following aphorism:</p>
<p><em>Man, being the servant and interpreter of Nature, can do and understand so much and so much only as he has observed in fact or in thought of the course of nature. Beyond this he neither knows anything nor can do anything.</em></p>
<p>In other words, we know about stuff we can experience.</p>
<p>Nothing particularly earth-shattering, perhaps, to the modern ear. But this was a terrifyingly subversive claim to make. To start with, he is directly challenging the institutional Church and her claims to divinely revealed truth. To the pre-modern, ‘truth’ is something that is received from the hierarchy. The peasant receives instruction from the priest, who in turn receives instruction from the bishop, who receives his instruction from the Pope, who’s wisdom comes via divine revelation straight from God.</p>
<p>But Bacon is saying “no, the only way we can know things is through empiricism; through direct experience, through our own senses and observations.” And the implications of this are clear. If the hierarchy claims one thing, but we observe a fact that contradicts their claim, then they must be in error.</p>
<p>We’ll see how this conflict between revealed truth and observed truth played out most clearly in my next article, when we turn our attention to Galileo.</p>

                <h2><a href="/2012/03/02/redacted/">Redacted.</a></h2>
                
                
                <div class="entry-content">

                    
        
<p>Now this is fascinating.</p>
<p>Thanks to wikileaks, it is now possible to compare versions of some U.S. government documents that have been released under Freedom of Information Act requests, but in redacted form, with the actual raw documents themselves.  Thus we can have an insight not only into the material the documents cover, but also what topics the government censors feel must be withheld.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.aclu.org/wikileaks-diplomatic-cables-foia-documents">http://www.aclu.org/wikileaks-diplomatic-cables-foia-documents</a></p>
<p>In software development, one of the most frequently used tools is something we call <strong>diff</strong>.   A diff tool compares two versions of a text file, typically a design document or a the source code for a program, and highlights the changes between them.  For the programmer, this is a useful tool to see what has changed between versions, to see if any errors have crept into the source, to see what modifications other team members may have made to the file, and to see how the code has evolved over time.</p>
<p><a href="/images/2012/03/diff.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-456" height="321" sizes="(max-width: 511px) 100vw, 511px" src="/images/2012/03/diff.png" srcset="/images/2012/03/diff.png 511w, /images/2012/03/diff-300x188.png 300w" title="diff" width="511" /></a></p>
<p>I have a feeling that in the future this technology will become more prevalent in the legal and governmental world.   It will be possible to track all the changes on a government bill as it proceeds through the legislative process.  Any attempt by a politician to make significant changes shortly before the bill is passed will become very obvious.  In fact I hope that with the rise of this kind of tool, along with collaborative websites along the lines of Wikipedia, the Canadian population can become much more involved in understanding, reviewing and  contributing to the legislative process.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">

                    
        
<p>I believe that one can trace a very logical historical path from the rise of modernism through to the development of postmodernism. However, I probably won’t keep these article in strict chronological order. Be prepared for me to hop and skip around!</p>
<p>Before I can talk about postmodernity, I need to establish where we’re coming from. And this means talking about the successes of modernism.</p>
<p>I mentioned in my introduction that I see the the Swedish company Ikea as representing the epitome of modernism. Ikea manages a seamless blend of form and function to channel the individual desires of millions of people into achieving the goals of the company.</p>
<p>This is ne of the greatest achievements of modernism: the ability to create large scale organisations dedicated to achieving a <em>single</em> goal.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, Henry Ford. Before his company revolutionised the industry, cars were manufactured by hand. With the introduction of the assembly line, each component was constructed or attached by one individual or team. The workers didn’t need to know how to build an entire car, but just how to do their assigned task over and over again. The efficiency gains were staggering. While a car had previously taken more than 12 man-hours to assemble, now it could be done in a mere ninety minutes.</p>
<p>But interestingly enough, the history of the production line goes back a long way before Henry Ford. In the early 19th century the British Navy needed to make over 100,000 wooden blocks a year to equip her ships, and all of them needed to be manufactured by hand by craftsmen. This process was dramatically overhauled by Marc Isambard Brunel, who designed a series of steam powered machines, each of which could perform one element of the block-making process. When working together, and operated by relatively unskilled labour, blocks could be manufactured with significantly improved quality and speed. This was the first production line in England, although the concept did not spread to other industries for decades.</p>
<p>The key features of this system, as with Ford’s, were a carefully designed manufacturing process and the assignment of simple, repetitive tasks to unskilled, interchangeable workers.</p>
<p>The other pioneers of this approach were armies. Prior to large corporations, armies were the only structure that organised on this scale, and with the same features. Armies have a hierarchical command structure, a single purpose, and make heavy use of interchangeable, low value units. Military education is a machine for producing soldiers. The individual soldier in a war does not need to see the big picture, or understand strategy, but merely needs to perform their assigned task correctly and efficiently. And if one, or a hundred, or ten thousand are killed, then they can be replaced with identically trained units. To the General, there is little difference between an infantryman and a gun carriage. I think of Napoleon as one of the foremost proponents of this approach, with his <em>Levee en Masse</em>, a startling ability to raise, train and equip vast armies, with which he could overwhelm the smaller professional armies of other European states.</p>
<p>These are some of the key characteristics of modernism: carefully designed processes, efficiencies of scale, and the use of interchangeable workers. And these characteristics were so successful that in the 20th century they spread out of the factory and into the office, the store, and the restaurant. Consider your local Tim Horton’s franchise, for example. Every Tim Horton’s in the country follows the same process for preparing a ham sandwich; each step has a fixed number of seconds allocated, and these times are printed directly above the food preparation area. A franchise, at it’s heart, is a set of carefully designed processes that can be run by interchangeable staff with minimum training.</p>
<p>These economies of scale have brought us affordable cars, quick service at the coffee shop, and many other impressive achievements. Killer diseases such as smallpox were eradicated through large scale, efficient vaccination programs. The introduction of city-wide sanitation infrastructure in London in the 19th century dramatically curtailed incidences of Cholera. And the Prussian education system, which emphasises a standardised curriculum and teacher training methodology, has been adopted worldwide.</p>
<p>So although in later articles I will outline modernisms darker side, I want to make clear that I do not see it as ‘bad’ or ‘good’. It is at it’s core a set of organisational tools. What we as a society choose to do with these tools is up to us.</p>

<p>This will be a short article, as I unfortunately arrived very late for the Sunday morning service at <a href="http://www.stmargaretbarrie.ca/">St. Margaret’s Church</a> last week.  However, despite my tardiness, I had a very positive visit.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/images/2012/02/IMG_00000092.jpg"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-441 aligncenter" height="168" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="/images/2012/02/IMG_00000092-300x168.jpg" srcset="/images/2012/02/IMG_00000092-300x168.jpg 300w, /images/2012/02/IMG_00000092-1024x575.jpg 1024w" title="IMG_00000092" width="300" /></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The building is only 12 years old, and has a wonderful airy design.  From the sanctuary you can look out through windows on either side directly into the subdivision the church is located in.   The architecture gives the church a feeling of being rooted in the local community.</p>
<p>I had an interesting conversation after the service with Reverend Stephen Pessah.  We talked about the fact that for churches located in urban cores, usually the needs of the local community are very obvious.  Poverty, crime, housing difficulties and so on are usually quite visible.  But in suburbia, although the needs may be very real, they are frequently hidden behind a veneer of respectability.  You cannot immediately distinguish between a a resident who is comfortably well off or on the verge of bankrupt – they may both drive an SUV, dress smartly, and so on.</p>
<p>Furthermore I’m convinced there are more forms of poverty than simply financial.  Our community can frequently suffer from relational poverty, as we isolate ourselves in our detached houses behind our ‘good neighbour’ fences.  Or we can suffer from poverty of imagination, as we trudge through a lifestyle we find unfulfilling but can’t imagine changing.   Or we can wrestle with poverty of hope – an inability to dream that life might one day be different than it is today.</p>
<p>St. Margaret’s will be holding a series of contemplative services during Lent, which I’m pleased to here.  I’m convinced that the church in Barrie needs a healthy contemplative stream of Christianity.  Brian McLaren, in his book ‘A Generous Orthodoxy’, says</p>
<p><em>I’ve noticed that among the people most dedicated to missional activism, you find either (a) people burned out because of the difficulty of the task, or (b) people who have best learned to undergird their activism with contemplation, with quiet resting, with finding God in the center of normalcy… Contemplation isn’t only for passive, withdrawn people, but also for active, involved ones.</em></p>
<p>Overall, I felt very welcomed at St. Margaret’s.   In many ways, Anglicanism still feels like ‘home’ to me.  I find that good Anglicanism strikes a very healthy balance: formal without being stuffy, orthodox without being exclusivist, liturgical while remaining accessible; a global denomination constructed entirely of local communities.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">

                    
        
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This month I’ll be starting a new series exploring <em>modernism</em> and <em>postmodernism</em>.</p>
<p>I’ve become more and more convinced that the distinction between these two ways of seeing the world is one of the most significant cultural distinctions in our society, and that understanding the differences between the two is invaluable in understanding the world we live in.</p>
<p>Le Corbusier, a famous modernist architect, said that houses should be ‘<a href="http://renaissancenow.ca/2011/02/12/machines-for-working-in/" title="Machines for Working In.">machines for living in</a>‘.</p>
<p>The swedish company Ikea I believe has applied this exact same philosophy, and created a ‘machine for shopping in’.</p>
<p>I love the Ikea experience, in part because of the fascinating way that the company has taken the idea of a production line and applied to it to retail. Just imagine your last trip to the store. You arrived in the front door, dropped your kids of at the <em>Småland</em> and then were guided carefully along a pre-planned route, following a pattern designed and refined from uncounted time-and-motion studies. Every corner, every display, the length of time taken to walk through the store, has been planned to make parting with your money as comfortable for you as possible. And even though you came in to just pick up a few dish towels you walked out 2 <em>Billys,</em> a <em>Duktig</em> and a <em>Skärpt.</em></p>
<p>However, if I’m really looking for a bargain, I don’t go to Ikea. I turn to Freecycle, or Kijiji, or eBay. In these environments, the distinction between vendor and consumer is much more blurred. I might be selling a couch but buying a bike. I’m not dealing with a single efficient corporate entity like Walmart, but an uncountable number of individuals. The experience is less organised, less controlled, more inter-connected, and perhaps more chaotic.</p>
<p>If Ikea represents the pinnacle of Modernist design, then I expect that decentralised internet marketplaces may be the post-modern equivalent.</p>
<p>Postmodernism recognizes that there are many different perspectives on the world, so rather than trying to present formal definitions of these two philosophies, I’ll instead be taking a meandering journey through my own observations. So, first some characteristics.</p>
<h2>Characteristics of modernism and postmodernism</h2>
<ul>
<li>Moderns look to experts for advice. Postmoderns look to their networks.</li>
<li>Modernism is structured. Postmodernism is organic.</li>
<li>Modernism cares about being efficient. Postmodernism cares about being healthy.</li>
<li>Modernism talks about principles. Postmodernism tells stories.</li>
<li>Modernism is a symphony orchestra. Postmodernism is a drumming circle.</li>
<li>Modernism is linear. Postmodernism is fractal.</li>
<li>Modernism is ordered. Postmodernism is chaotic.</li>
<li>Classical physics is modern. Quantum mechanics is postmodern.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Where I’m going</h2>
<p>So, I have a lot of ground to cover. In the coming months, I hope to at least touch on: the Enlightenment, Francis Bacon, the Industrial Revolution, Henry Ford, the production line, the rise of modern sanitation, healthcare and education, Newtonian physics, the Ultraviolet Catastrophe, determinism, thermodynamics, the Holocaust, quantum mechanics, Schrodinger’s cat, chaos theory, Kurt Godel, modern architecture, Le Corbusier, Conway’s ‘game of life’, the Toyota Production System, the concept of ’emergence’, and probably quite a lot else.</p>
<p>In doing so, I hope to demonstrate how Postmodernism isn’t ‘anti-modernism’, or a passing fad, but rather a logical and inevitable consequence of modernism.</p>

                <h2><a href="/2012/02/07/church-21-first-christian-reformed/">Church 21 – First Christian Reformed</a></h2>
                
                
                <div class="entry-content">

                    
        
<p><a href="/images/2012/02/IMG_00000086.jpg"><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-424" height="168" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="/images/2012/02/IMG_00000086-300x168.jpg" srcset="/images/2012/02/IMG_00000086-300x168.jpg 300w, /images/2012/02/IMG_00000086-1024x575.jpg 1024w" title="IMG_00000086" width="300" /></a> When I told my daughter I’d visited the ‘First Christian Reformed’ church on Sunday, she asked me if it really was the first ever Christian church. I told her that, no, despite the name, it wasn’t.</p>
<p>However, it is a warm, friendly congregation.  Unlike some places I’ve been where I’ve been able to stand around at coffee hour for twenty minutes without anyone talking to me, at this church three or four people had introduced themselves to me, got me a coffee, and started to get to know me before the service had even started.  So full marks for hospitality!</p>
<p>This is another of Barrie’s larger churches, with several hundred people in the Sunday morning service.   The format is very typically Evangelical.  We sung several songs accompanied by a small band, there were announcements,  a short message for the children, a brief prayer,  and a thirty minute sermon.</p>
<p>I’ve found myself asking recently when and why the <em>sermon</em> replaced <em>communion</em> as the central sacrament of the Protestant church.   I’m sure no Catholic would feel that they had really ‘gone to church’ if Mass had not been celebrated.  And likewise, I suspect an Evangelical feels that they have not ‘gone to church’ unless they have heard a sermon.</p>
<p>It may not formally be referred to as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrament">sacrament</a>, but it certainly gets treated like one.   It’s clear to a casual visitor of this church that the sermon is the main point of both the Sunday morning meeting and, in fact, the entire building.   Just as an Anglican or Catholic church has as an altar as its focal point, this church clearly is centered around the pulpit.</p>
<p>I’m fairly sure that the point of the ritual of the sermon is about more than simple information transfer.  This is not just about educating a congregation.  Not least, there are clearly more efficient ways to transfer information.  You could read the texts for 52 sermons in a few hours on the first day of January.  And there are certainly more <em>effective</em> ways to transfer information.   Any decent degree program complements its lectures with tutorials to discuss the material, with practicals to investigate the subject first hand, and with exams to monitor progress.</p>
<p>As far as I know, most churches don’t have a formal curriculum, nor any way of assessing student progress, so I really don’t think that the point of a sermon is fundamentally about education.  And indeed, as I’ve been asking people on this journey <em>why</em> they go to church, I’ve rarely heard the answer ‘to hear a sermon’.</p>
<p>And yet we construct buildings, hire staff, and organise services largely in order to deliver sermons.   I can only assume that this is because we believe that sermons do, in fact, have some kind of sacramental value.  That maybe people are influenced in some spiritual way by the act of sitting in a chair and listening to somebody talk for thirty minutes.   And that this has to happen on a consistent, weekly basis to have the desired effect.</p>
<p>Understand that this is a general question, and not a criticism of First Christian Reformed church.  Pastor Mike Borgert gave an engaging message on <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%201:29-34&amp;version=NIV">Mark 1:29-34</a>, although he somehow managed to talk for thirty minutes about a four-verse passage that includes multiple healings and exorcisms without really talking about the supernatural elements of the story at all.</p>
<p>But my question remains – why the centrality of the sermon?  When did this become the focal point of ‘doing church’?  And what are we fundamentally trying to achieve?</p>

                <h2><a href="/2012/01/30/church-20-st-john-vianney/">Church 20 – St. John Vianney</a></h2>
                
                
                <div class="entry-content">

                    
        
<p><a href="/images/2012/01/IMG_00000083.jpg"><img alt="" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-420" height="168" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="/images/2012/01/IMG_00000083-300x168.jpg" srcset="/images/2012/01/IMG_00000083-300x168.jpg 300w, /images/2012/01/IMG_00000083-1024x575.jpg 1024w" title="IMG_00000083" width="300" /></a>Yesterday I visited the third and final Catholic church in Barrie.   Liturgically it was very similar to the others, of course, although I did notice that unlike the other churches, as<a href="http://www.stjohnvianney.ca/"> St. John Vianney</a> they give both bread <em>and  </em>wine at communion.</p>
<p>I also finally had the chance to sit down with a priest after the service and talk a bit about the church.  This is the first chance I’ve had to talk to an ‘official’ representative of the catholic church.</p>
<p>I have a lot of questions I’d love to ask the entire Catholic hierarchy, not least ‘how can we patch up the appalling mess that we all made during the Reformation, and while we’re at it, the Great Schism as well, and get on with this whole Kingdom of God business?’</p>
<p>However, my time was limited.  So I stuck to my usual questions: “why are you here,” and “what is God doing in the city?”  And I got probably the most comprehensive answers I’ve yet heard.</p>
<p>The priest talked to me about the church being a place where people are both drawn in to worship God, and then inspired to go outwards and serve the poor and the needy.  God, he said, works through people, and he calls each of us to serve others.</p>
<p>Within the formal structure of the Catholic Church in Barrie, there are various organisations such as the <a href="http://www.ssvp.on.ca/">Society of St Vincent de Paul</a>, the <a href="https://www.kofc.org/en//index.html">Knights of Columbus</a>, and the <a href="http://www.cwl.ca/">Catholic Women’s League</a> that provide specific opportunities for individuals to serve the poor and demonstrate Christ’s love.   And St. John Vianney tries to pool its resources with the other churches in the city to more effectively have an impact on society.</p>
<p>All this I deeply respect, of course.  But I still find the lack of communion between Catholics and other denominations deeply troubling.   In answer to my inquiries the priest told me that yes, I really did have to pick one side of the fence or the other.  If you want to take communion in a Catholic church then you have to first take Catholic baptism, and having done so you would not be allowed to share in the Eucharist at another church.</p>
<p>As I’ve said <a href="http://renaissancenow.ca/2012/01/20/church-18-st-marys-catholic-church/" title="Church 18 – St. Mary’s Catholic Church">before</a>, I’m a passionate believer in open communion.  I don’t want to have to pick sides in a fight that happened centuries before I was born. I want to be able to eat, pray, and worship alongside my brothers and sisters from across the Christian spectrum.  And it saddens me that there are still ecclesiastical rules that forbid me from doing this.</p>
<p>I will say that I felt listened to and respected as I talked about this yesterday.  We may struggle with a great deal of historical baggage, but I am grateful every time I encounter someone who shares my desire to bridge the gaps that divide us.</p>

                <h2><a href="/2012/01/22/church-19-m/">Church 19 – ‘M’</a></h2>
                
                
                <div class="entry-content">

                    
        
<p>Yes, today we visited a church who’s name is a single letter.  Because that’s pretty hard to search for in Google, here is their <a href="http://startswithm.org/" title="Starts With M">website</a>!.</p>
<p>‘M’ was quite a contrast from <a href="http://renaissancenow.ca/2012/01/20/church-18-st-marys-catholic-church/" title="Church 18 – St. Mary’s Catholic Church">last week’s</a> Catholic service.  Instead of large, structured and formal, this morning’s service had an almost improvised feel.  ‘M’ is a new community, and so I suspect that at the moment there is no such thing as a typical gathering.    This morning was billed as ‘Bring It’ Sunday, a chance for all members to share a song, a thought, a poem, a reading, or a painting.</p>
<p><a href="/images/2012/01/IMG_00000074.jpg"><img alt="" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-416" height="168" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="/images/2012/01/IMG_00000074-300x168.jpg" srcset="/images/2012/01/IMG_00000074-300x168.jpg 300w, /images/2012/01/IMG_00000074-1024x575.jpg 1024w" title="IMG_00000074" width="300" /></a>Personally, I love this kind of interactive environment.  ‘M’ meets at the <a href="http://thecreativespace.ca/">Creative Space</a> in downtown Barrie, which is an ideal venue for getting a bunch of folks together in a circle to drink coffee, share ideas, listen, talk, and learn.</p>
<p>In some ways, this feels very contemporary, but the idea of group-led worship is nothing new.  The Brethren movement has been doing this kind of thing for more than a century.  Following Paul’s suggestions in <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2014:26&amp;version=NIV">1 Corinthians 14:26</a>, a typical Brethren service, although centered around communion, sets aside a generous chunk of time for anyone present to share with the group a thought, a prayer or a song.</p>
<p>The difference between this kind of church service and a more formally structured one is, perhaps, like the difference between going to a classical concert and taking part in a drumming circle.  The former may be more polished, more predictable, and perhaps ‘safer’.  The latter may be more chaotic, but is definitely more participatory.  Everyone plays a part, and when done well, everyone listens to and responds to each person’s contribution.</p>
<p>‘M’ is still figuring out what it wants to be, I think.  But, if you’re the kind of person who prefers dialog to lecture, or improvisation to formality, then I’d recommend that you pay them a visit.</p>
<p> </p>
