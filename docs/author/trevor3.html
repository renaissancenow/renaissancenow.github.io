                <h2><a href="/2014/03/23/autism-and-god/">Autism and God</a></h2>
                
                
                <div class="entry-content">

                    
        
<p>I am on the autism spectrum.  I am also a committed Christian.</p>
<p>This makes me a bit of an anomaly.  According to Catherine Chaldwell-Harris at the Boston University Department of Psychology, people with autism spectrum disorder are <a href="http://csjarchive.cogsci.rpi.edu/proceedings/2011/papers/0782/paper0782.pdf">far more likely than their peers to reject religious belief</a> and identify as atheist or agnostic.  The chair of a national autism organization has gone as far as to say that autistic children will automatically be atheist because they “<em><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/04/30/turkish-autism-autism_n_3183843.html">lack a section for faith in their brains</a>.”</em></p>
<p>A quick survey of people I know on the spectrum found this statement deeply offensive.  It is frustrating at two levels – it demonstrates a poor understanding of the nature of religious faith and it demonstrates a poor understanding of the nature of autism.</p>
<p><span id="more-1089"></span>To understand the challenges that the church has when engaging with autism, let’s talk briefly about what autism is.  Autism is fundamentally characterized by difficulties in understand the mental and emotional state of other people, and a tendency towards systemizing behaviour.  In my case, this means that I struggle to know what other people are thinking and feeling; indeed I sometimes struggle to know what <em>I</em> am feeling.</p>
<p>And there we have a problem. Because faith is often talked about in terms of emotions, and specifically in terms of <em>God’s</em> emotions.   I’ve frequently heard people say “<em>I really felt that God was telling me to change jobs”, </em>or “<em>I feel that God wants me to tell you something”, </em>or <em>“I felt a leading to go on a missions trip.”  </em></p>
<p><a class="thumbnail" href="/images/2014/03/trinity.jpg"><img alt="trinity" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1091" height="274" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="/images/2014/03/trinity-300x274.jpg" srcset="/images/2014/03/trinity-300x274.jpg 300w, /images/2014/03/trinity.jpg 535w" width="300" /></a>In the evangelical world this is a very normal way of speaking.  Historically, we have placed a deep emphasis on the personal nature of faith, on the idea that a relationship with God is something that is open to everyone, without the need for mediation through an institution or a priesthood.  And we have taught that the individual believer can receive direction and instruction from God.</p>
<p>And here is where I struggle.  Because when people say “I really feel that God wants…”, they’re telling me that they are intuiting the wants and desires and emotional state of a divine being.</p>
<p>But  I have difficulty intuiting the wants, desires, and emotional states of everyday people.  I have difficulty figuring out the emotional states of my friends and family.  I have difficulty sensing the emotional states of my wife.  Frankly, I have difficulty seeing my <em>own</em> emotional states.</p>
<p>So if active participation in my faith requires being able to sense how some Other is feeling, then I have a problem.  It’s almost like telling someone with club foot that running a marathon is a necessary entry requirement to this club that we call the church.</p>
<hr />
<p>Before I started writing this article, I did some research to see what had already been written on the subject of autism and religion.  Unfortunately, there’s very little.  There is the study I referenced above that saw the correlation between autism and atheism.  There are a few articles that talk about how to bring your children to church without triggering a meltdown.  And there are a few resources that note that the churchgoing experience has the possibility to trigger some of the sensory processing issues that are so common in people on the spectrum.  Loud noises, large crowds, a requirement to sit still for an hour, strange sounds, smells and tastes; all of these can trigger sensory overload.  Going to church can become an exercise in crisis management, not an opportunity to engage in a faith community in a profound, transformative way.</p>
<p>But I believe that autism <em>is</em> a theological issue.  How we talk about it, how we describe it and how we think about it will affect how we treat people on the spectrum.  And it will affect how we learn <em>from</em> people on the spectrum.  Fundamentally, we will have to decide whether we see autism as a <strong>disease</strong> to be cured, or a <strong>difference</strong> to be cherished.</p>

                <h2><a href="/2014/03/02/sevastopol-is-russias-faslane/">Sevastopol is Russia’s Faslane</a></h2>
                
                
                <div class="entry-content">

                    
        
<p>In the last couple of days, Russian troops have moved to occupy Simferapol in the Crimean peninsula.  This may be part of a larger effort to deter the Ukraine from continuing to turn towards Europe for patronage, but a quick glance at the map makes at least part of Russia’s motivation very clear.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea_Fleet">Russian Black Sea Fleet</a> is stationed in Sevastopol.  Ever since the breakup of the Soviet Union there has been tension between Russia and the Ukraine over her continued presence, and Russia’s lease was only extended a few years ago.  The fleet has had it’s home there for <em>two hundred and thirty years.</em>  I cannot imagine that Russia would be willing to lose this critical part of her strategic protection.   And if we look at the <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@46.5731668,32.8541483,7z">map</a>, we see that the only main road to Sevastopol passes through Simferopol, the administrative centre of Crimea.  If Simferopol is secured and under Russian control, the Black Fleet is safe.</p>
<p>The British equivalent might be Faslane Naval base, home of her nuclear fleet.  I cannot imagine the UK countenancing any threat to Faslane, although the demands for Scottish independence must surely be giving the Navy’s senior commanders some serious headaches right now.</p>
<p>But back to the Crimea.  Shocking though it is to see Russia so casually violate the sovereignty of a neighbour, I can only hope that her purpose is merely to defend a key military installation, rather than to forcefully shepherd the entire Ukraine back into a closer union with her former overlords.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">

                    
        
<p>It’s back!  It might be -20 outside, with huge snow piles lining my driveway, but in Australia the sun is beating down an the cycling season has formally begun, with the first stage of the Tour Down Under.  This feels like the first hint that Spring might one day return.</p>
<p>Cycling might be a terribly tainted sport, and it has certainly suffered a ridiculous number of scandals over the past few years.  The Tour de France records <strong>no</strong> official winner for the years 1999-2005.    And even laying aside the well-know doping habits of Lance Armstrong, many, many other names from that era are also tainted: Levi Leipheimer, Floyd Llandis, Tyler Hamilton, David Millar, Bjarne Riis – the list goes on and on.   I sometimes think that the only good think to come out of that decade was the book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.ca/The-Secret-Race-Cover-ups-Winning/dp/0345530411">The Secret Race</a>,</em><em> </em> by Tyler Hamilton, which documents in-depth the length that competitors felt they were forced to go to to remain viable competitors.</p>
<p>And yet, despite all that, I still love the sport.  I love the spectacle of it, I love the many-races-in-one format of the Grand Tours, I love the interpersonal dynamics of the racers, as sprinters and climbers and GC contenders make alliances of convenience and conduct diplomatic negotiations at sixty kilometers an hour; I love the thrill of the twisting descents of the final kilometers of Milan-San Remo, I love the mud-splattered brutality of the Paris-Roubaix, I love watching the <em>peloton</em> snake its way through the Flanders countryside I used to live in, and I love the rare occasions when I get to attend a race in person and feel and hear the hum of derailleurs inches from where I’m sitting.</p>
<p>I can hope that with the introduction of the biological passport, and with new leadership at the UCI, that the sport is slowly becoming a place where athletes can genuinely contend on their own merit, and I can also hope that the UCI adopts the egalitarian spirit of the International Olympic Committee and re-instates a <a href="https://www.change.org/petitions/aso-amaury-sports-organization-allow-female-professional-cycling-teams-to-race-the-tour-de-france">Women’s edition of the Tour de France.</a></p>
<p>But for now, enjoy some highlights from the first stage of racing of the year.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">

                    
        
<p>JFK once said that the only reason to give a speech was to change the world.</p>
<p>I think this is wise advice.  I’ve been reading a lot recently about the art of speaking and presenting, and the true masters of the subject seem to agree on a couple of points.</p>
<p>Firstly, PowerPoint is evil.  Or at least, can be used as a tool for evil.  Consider the following slide, for example.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a class="thumbnail" href="/images/2014/01/Afgan-COIN.jpg"><img alt="Afgan-COIN" class="size-full wp-image-1076 aligncenter" height="378" sizes="(max-width: 505px) 100vw, 505px" src="/images/2014/01/Afgan-COIN.jpg" srcset="/images/2014/01/Afgan-COIN.jpg 505w, /images/2014/01/Afgan-COIN-300x224.jpg 300w" width="505" /></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>That’s part of a <a href="http://www.vizworld.com/2010/04/afghan-wars-true-enemy-powerpoint/#sthash.HaFTgkxK.dpbs">real PowerPoint presentation</a> given by a real military commander trying to explain the goals of the occupying force in Afghanistan.  I don’t understand it.  I’m sure the audience didn’t understand it.  And I’m not at all sure that the guy giving the presentation really understood it.  If you can’t get your key point across in a few sentences, you’re probably not sure what you’re trying to say.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the masters of presenting agree on a second point.  <em>Speaking and presenting is about telling stories.</em></p>
<p>Consider this example:</p>
<p><a class="thumbnail" href="/images/2014/01/stories1.jpg"><img alt="stories" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1078" height="377" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" src="/images/2014/01/stories1.jpg" srcset="/images/2014/01/stories1.jpg 500w, /images/2014/01/stories1-300x226.jpg 300w" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>This is from a vastly better presentation, <em><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/powerfulpoint/pixar-22rulestophenomenalstorytellingpowerfulpointslideshare">Pixar’s 22 Rules to Phenomenal Storytelling</a>.</em> Go and watch it now.  Seriously.  I’ll wait.</p>
<p>Done?  Good.  The author of that presentation had a clear point he wanted to make, and made it with simplicity, creativity, and a keen eye for design.  All the hallmarks, in fact, of the company that he’s talking about.</p>
<p>If, like JFK, we want to change the world, we’ll need to do better than endless bullet lists and obfuscated flow charts.  We’ll need to learn to tell honest, simple, engaging stories.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>Yes, it’s that time of year again, when magazines and websites are full of articles about New Year’s Resolutions.</p>
<p>Actually, I quite like this tradition.  While I’m only too aware of the low success rate of resolutions, I think the turn of the year is an excellent time to stop, take stock of your life, and plan ahead for the coming months.</p>
<p>I have some specific practices that I find extremely helpful in this exercise that I’ll be sharing on Sunday at <a href="http://voxalliance.ca/">Vox Alliance</a>, but in the meantime, I’m interested in hearing from you.  Do you make resolutions? Do you stick to them?  What resolutions do you make?  And what are you looking forward to in 2014?</p>

<p>As soon as you start working on the Linux command line, you have to start working with files.  Linux follows a very powerful design philosophy expressed as <em>everything is a file. </em>This can take some getting used to, but is incredibly useful once you get it.  Because once you’ve learned how to read and manipulate text files, you can do pretty much anything on your machine.</p>
<p>The first command you need to know is <code>cat</code>. Cat is short for ‘concatenate’, and is used for writing text to and from files. So if I have a file in my current working directory, I can get its contents with cat:</p>
<pre><code><span id="more-1058"></span>
$ echo "hello world" &gt; myfile.txt
$ cat myfile.txt 
hello world
</code></pre>
<p>The first line created the file <code>myfile.txt</code> and directed the string “hello world” into it. The second line used <code>cat</code> to read the contents of the file.</p>
<p>Here’s a more real-world example</p>
<pre><code>$ cat /var/log/syslog</code></pre>
<p>This prints out all the lines in the <code>syslog</code> file, present on most unix systems. Don’t worry too much about the contents of the file, it’s probably mostly log records from your system booting up. Now, if you’re inspecting a log file, very often you only want the last few lines, rather than the entire thing. Linux provides a useful command for this very purpose</p>
<pre><code>$ tail /var/log/syslog</code></pre>
<p>Tail, as you might guess, prints out the ‘tail’, or last few lines, of a file. Its companion is <code>head</code>, which prints the first few lines</p>
<pre><code>$ head /var/log/syslog</code></pre>
<p>If you want the ability to view large amounts of text and scroll through it, then the command you want is ‘<code>less</code>‘.</p>
<pre><code>$ less /var/log/syslog</code></pre>
<p>This allows you to scroll up and down through your file. Press <b>q</b> to return to the command line.</p>
<p>Here’s one last neat little trick. I mentioned that on Linux, <i>everything is a file</i>. Even the state of the system is represented as a file.</p>
<pre><code>
trevor@vm2:~$ cat /proc/cpuinfo 
processor	: 0
vendor_id	: GenuineIntel
cpu family	: 6
model		: 70
model name	: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4850HQ CPU @ 2.30GHz
stepping	: 1
microcode	: 0xf
cpu MHz		: 2294.218
cache size	: 6144 KB
...
</code></pre>
<p>Rather than having many different tools for different tasks, a Linux system is more like a box of Lego. The same tools can be plugged into all sorts of different places to enable you to do what you want. I use the humble <code>cat</code> command on a daily basis to modify system settings, read files, and even monitor the health of my machines.</p>

<p>I pretty much live on the Linux command line.  There’s a number of tools I have in my ‘toolkit’ that I use on a daily basis to automate tasks, manage systems and provide features.</p>
<p><code>apt-get</code> is one of the most important tools to understand if you’re using an Ubuntu distribution.</p>
<p><code>apt-get</code> is like the Apple App Store, except it’s been around for much longer and everything it provides is absolutely free. When I’m setting up a new Linux machine I immediately download and install several useful packages.</p>
<pre><code>
$ sudo apt-get install ipython
$ sudo apt-get install nmap
$ sudo apt-get install mercurial
</code></pre>
<p>and so on.  Very quickly your new Linux machine can be a database server, a graphic design workstation, or a development engine.</p>
<p><span id="more-1022"></span>Several apt-get commands are worth knowing</p>
<p><img alt="photo" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-1029" height="150" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" src="/images/2013/11/photo-150x150.png" srcset="/images/2013/11/photo-150x150.png 150w, /images/2013/11/photo-300x300.png 300w, /images/2013/11/photo.png 512w" width="150" /></p>
<p><code>$ apt-get install nmap</code>, for example, installs a powerful port-scanner.</p>
<p><code>$ apt-get remove nmap</code> removes the package we just installed.</p>
<p><code>$ apt-get upgrade</code> upgrades all installed packages to the latest version</p>
<p>Even more powerfully,</p>
<p><code>$ do-release-upgrade </code>upgrades your Ubuntu system when a new one is released.   To find out what version of Ubuntu you’re running, I suggest <code>$ lsb_release</code>. On my machine it gives the following output:</p>
<pre><code>$ lsb_release -a
No LSB modules are available.
Distributor ID: Ubuntu
Description: Ubuntu 13.10
Release: 13.10
Codename: saucy</code></pre>
<p>Check <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/" title="ubuntu.com">http://www.ubuntu.com/</a> to see what the latest release version is.</p>
<p>Have fun!</p>

<p>Linux gives you all sorts of ways of keeping an eye on what’s going on your server.  Here are several that I find useful.  Read my post on <a href="http://renaissancenow.ca/2013/11/28/apt-get-making-your-ubuntu-machine-more-better/" title="apt-get: Making your ubuntu machine more better">apt-get</a> to get any of these that may not be installed on your computer.</p>
<p>The grand-daddy of them all is <b>top</b><br />
<span id="more-1036"></span><br />
This is like Task Manager on Windows or Activity Monitor on Mac.  It gives you a quick list of all the processes that are running on your computer, how much RAM and processor power they’re using, and how long they’ve been running for.</p>
<p><strong>top</strong>, however has a pretty ugly output format, so it’s good that there are several better alternatives.</p>
<p>My preferred tool is <code>htop</code>, which gives a better visual display, including a nice bar-chart showing CPU usage on all your cores, and the ability to sort by CPU, memory usage etc.</p>
<pre><code>
  CPU[||                                                                          1.3%]     Tasks: 44, 46 thr; 1 running
  Mem[|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||  332/987MB]     Load average: 0.00 0.01 0.05 
  Swp[|                                                                       0/1021MB]     Uptime: 1 day, 13:00:40

  PID USER      PRI  NI  VIRT   RES   SHR S CPU% MEM%   TIME+  Command
24133 trevor     20   0 26420  2756  1456 R  0.7  0.3  0:00.57 htop
 1030 root       20   0 91728  4412  3572 S  0.0  0.4  2:21.86 /usr/sbin/vmtoolsd
 1051 postgres   20   0  129M  5056  3628 S  0.0  0.5  0:24.74 postgres: writer process

</code></pre>
<h3>So what’s making my disk thrash?</h3>
<p><b>htop</b> tells us what processes are using memory and processing power. To see what’s using I/O, use <code>iotop</code>. This needs to be run as root:</p>
<pre><code>
$ sudo apt-get install iotop
$ sudo iotop
</code></pre>
<p>which gives you a list of which processes are reading and writing to disk.</p>
<h3>But what’s using my network connection?</h3>
<p>Likewise, we can monitor network usage using <code>iftop</code></p>
<pre><code>
$ sudo apt-get install iftop
$ sudo iftop</code></pre>
<p>which shows the open connections on your machine and how much data is being passed through them.</p>
<p>An alternative to <code>iftop</code> is <code>nethogs</code> which shows you which processes are responsible for data being passed over your network connections.</p>
<p>I also find <code>netstat</code> useful in these situations. <code>netstat</code> can do a lot, but one way I find myself using it a lot is</p>
<pre><code> $ netstat -plnt </code></pre>
<p>which means ‘show me all the processes on this machine that are listening for TCP/IP connections, and which port they are listening on’. This is very helpful when you’re setting up a machine and you want to verify that, say, your webserver or database server is running correctly.</p>
<p>Linux gives you many, many ways to see what’s going on on your system, and we’ve only scratched the surface her. Check out the rest of my technology toolkit posts:</p>

                <div class="entry-content">

                    
        
<p>If you’re a network administrator or web developer of any kind, you are often going to want to know what your machines are doing.  Is your database machine connected to the network?  Is your firewall working?  Is your web server properly configured?</p>
<p><code>ping</code> is the very first tool that we reach for.<br />
<span id="more-1051"></span><br />
  <code>ping</code> simply sends a message to another machine to see if it is responding.</p>
<pre><code>$ ping google.com</code></pre>
<p>When you run this, you should start seeing responses from google.com getting printed out at your command line. If you don’t get this, then your network connection is probably down. This can also be used to see if machines that you own are up and running.</p>
<pre><code>$ ping mywebserver</code></pre>
<p>If <code>ping</code> doesn’t work, and you’re sure that you are connected to the network, the next thing to do is to make sure that you have the right machine name and that your client machine can look up its IP address correctly. That’s where <code>dig</code> comes in.</p>
<pre><code>$ dig mycoolsite.ca </code></pre>
<p>Check that this gives you the right IP address. Be aware that some DNS providers such as <a href="http://www.opendns.com/">OpenDNS</a> may give you back an IP address even for sites that don’t exist, but it won’t be anything useful.</p>
<p><code>mtr</code> is like <code>ping</code> on steroids – it will show you all the hops that your network packets are taking between you and your target machine, and how responsive each intermediate machine is being. This is a very handy tool for analysing connectivity problems.</p>
<h4>My server is up, but what is it doing?</h4>
<p><code>nmap</code> is a vital tool in every network administrators toolkit. It deserves an article all to itself, but here’s a quick taste:</p>
<pre><code>trevor@vm2:~$ nmap localhost 

Starting Nmap 6.40 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2013-11-28 18:00 PST
Nmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1)
Host is up (0.000094s latency).
Not shown: 997 closed ports
PORT     STATE SERVICE
22/tcp   open  ssh
80/tcp   open  http
5432/tcp open  postgresql

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.04 seconds
</code></pre>
<p>This tells me that machine <b>vm2</b> is running ssh, a webserver, and the postgresql database engine. If this machine was visible to the outside world, now would be the time when I would make sure that postgresql wasn’t accepting non-local connections.</p>
<p>As with all these tools, nmap can be installed via</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install nmap</code></pre>

<p>As soon as I heard about the shooting at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Navy_Yard_shooting">Washington Navy Yard</a> on Monday, one question sprang to mind and refused to leave.</p>
<p>We are shocked, and rightly so, at the news of yet another mass shooting.  And yet, for some reason, most of us aren’t particularly shocked about the location of the shootings.  But I can’t help pondering the <em>location</em> of this act of violence, the Washington Navy Yard.  I’d never heard of this place until Monday, so I took the time to read up a little on the site and its history.</p>
<p>The Yard started out more than two centuries ago as the largest shipbuilding facility in the US navy.  By World War II, it was the largest naval ordnance plant in the world. The weapons designed and built there were used in every war in which the United States fought until the 1960s.</p>
<p>To put it another way, this facility has existed,  for two centuries, to create guns, torpedoes, gunboats, frigates and shells.  In short, all the machinery needed for people to kill other people with production-line efficiency.  To be blunt, this site has been in the business of mass-producing death. This is not a value judgment, just a plain statement of fact. Many thousands of human beings have been shot, blown up, burnt or drowned by the output of this facility.</p>
<p>And yet for some reason this doesn’t elicit a strong emotional reaction, or indeed, any comment at all in the coverage of Monday’s tragedy.</p>
<p>Why is that, I wonder?</p>
