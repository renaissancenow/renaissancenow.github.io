                <div class="entry-content">

                    
        
<p><a href="/images/2011/10/IMG_00000034.jpg"><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-292" height="168" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="/images/2011/10/IMG_00000034-300x168.jpg" srcset="/images/2011/10/IMG_00000034-300x168.jpg 300w, /images/2011/10/IMG_00000034-1024x575.jpg 1024w, /images/2011/10/IMG_00000034-500x280.jpg 500w" title="IMG_00000034" width="300" /></a>I’m not entirely sure what to think about Celebration Church, one of Barrie’s newest congregations.  I have two distinct impressions coming away from this morning’s service.</p>
<p>First is the unavoidable issue that this church exists because of a ‘divorce’.  Celebration’s origins are in a group of people that chose to leave Trinity Anglican mostly, as far as I can tell, over the issue of homosexuality.</p>
<p>I often compare the church to a large, sprawling, fractious, dysfunctional family.  And like a large family she has her fair share of fights.  As someone who is trying to find the common life of the church in Barrie, and to see what God is doing through the whole family in the city, it’s always painful to be witness to these splits, conflicts and divisions.  No matter what the cause, the entire family is hurt when two members have a falling out.</p>
<p>The second impression is far more positive.  Celebration may well be one of the most diverse congregations in the city.  The 70 or so in attendance today represented a broad generational and ethnic mix.   The style of worship drew on the Anglican tradition, spiced with elements of Pentecostalism.   It was a reminder that the family of God is truly a broad and diverse one.</p>
<p>Celebration Church is meeting on the property of Inniswood Baptist church, a location that is rapidly becoming a multi-church ‘campus’.  I think this could be a hopeful example of different congregations working together and complementing one another.</p>
<p>Once again after the service I got to share coffee and conversation with members of the church.  I get the feeling that Celebration church is trying hard to move forward from her acrimonious origins, and genuinely determine what God’s calling is for the congregation and the area.</p>
<hr />
<p>So, 10 churches down and at leas 60 more to go.  Is yours on my list?  Any suggestions as to where I should go next?  I’d also like to start connecting with the various para-church ministries that exist in the city, to get an even broader picture of the spiritual life of Barrie.  Please tell me if you think there are people or organizations I should be meeting!</p>

                <h2><a href="/2011/10/26/problems-of-abundance/">Problems of Abundance</a></h2>
                
                
                <div class="entry-content">

                    
        
<p>Nearly all the problems we face as a society today are problems of <em>abundance</em>.</p>
<p>Over the millennia, as a species we have become very skilled at dealing with scarcity.  Our ancestors often lived on the edge of survival.  They were one long winter, or one disease outbreak, or one failed harvest away from devastation.</p>
<p>And we have responded to these challenges by producing more.  We grow more crops, we mine more coal, we extract more oil, we build more cars.  But very soon our society will have to answer the question: <em>how much is enough?</em></p>
<p>Unemployment is seen as an under-supply of jobs.  But an equally valid way of looking at it is as an <a href="http://renaissancenow.ca/2011/09/07/question-3-what-is-meant-by-job-creation/" title="Question 3 – What is Meant by ‘Job Creation’">over-supply of labour</a>.  A society with unemployed members is a society that, as a whole, feels that it is using sufficient labour, and has no need for the efforts of some of its members.</p>
<p>Obesity, heart disease, diabetes and some cancers are also problems of abundance. A hunter gatherer society expends nearly every calorie it ingests in search of the next one.  But now we’ve figured out how to mass-produce calories.   Many of the health threats facing the developed and developing world are not due to lack of food, but to an <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=chronic-diseases-of-rich">over-abundance sugars, alcohol and tobacco</a>.</p>
<p>Pollution, likewise is a by product of the increased ability of our society to make stuff.  Everything that we dig out of the ground, or make in our factories, <a href="http://renaissancenow.ca/2011/08/30/question-1-is-gdp-a-good-measure-of-a-countrys-health/" title="Question 1 – is GDP a good measure of a country’s health?">has to one day find its way to the landfill or other resting place</a>.</p>
<p>So how much is enough?  Is it possible for a society to say “we have enough, we do not need to increase production?”  Is it possible for an individual to say “I have enough, I do not need to acquire more?”  Can a society see its over-supply of labour as an opportunity, not a problem?</p>
<p>I don’t have the answers to these questions yet.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">

                    
        
<p><a href="/images/2011/10/IMG_00000032.jpg"><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-269" height="168" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="/images/2011/10/IMG_00000032-300x168.jpg" srcset="/images/2011/10/IMG_00000032-300x168.jpg 300w, /images/2011/10/IMG_00000032-1024x575.jpg 1024w, /images/2011/10/IMG_00000032-500x280.jpg 500w" title="IMG_00000032" width="300" /></a>Two words came to mind as I sat in <a href="http://www.trinitybarrie.ca/index.php">Trinity Anglican</a> church this morning.  They were ‘beauty’ and ‘brokenness’.</p>
<p>This is because there are two ways of seeing this church.</p>
<p>On the one hand, I could see an aging population, a building in need of maintenance, and a congregation still healing from recent conflict.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I can see a church that has been serving downtown Barrie for 135 years, and is the repository of a rich spiritual heritage.  Three specific things struck me with their beauty this morning.  They were <em>architecture, music</em> and <em>theology. </em></p>
<p>Firstly, architecture.  This strikes you as soon as you walk into the building.  Trinity has the richest interior of any church I’ve visited so far.  The stained-glass windows, the ornate woodwork, the vaulted ceiling and the banners all collaborate in silently telling the gospel story.</p>
<p>Secondly, music.  Parts of the service were accompanied by guitar and vocals, and others by the choir.  There is something special about well sung choral music, and I was particularly touched by their rendition of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubi_caritas">Ubi Caritas</a> after communion.  The English text, ‘where charity and love are, God is there,’ was very appropriate for the theme of the service.</p>
<p>Finally, theology.  Through the singing, the prayers and the sermon, we explored the idea that love for God and love for one another is inextricably linked.   During the coffee time after the service I posed my usual questions about the purpose of church.  We talked about the church being a community where we can both receive the grace and love of God, and also be inspired to live out God’s love towards others.</p>
<p>Trinity also lives out her calling to minister to the city by hosting the <a href="http://www.busbycentre.ca/">David Busby Centre</a>, a drop in centre serving the homeless and at-risk of downtown Barrie.  Nearly every church I’ve been to so far has mentioned serving the poor as being a key part of what God is doing in the city.  Trinity is one of the places where this ministry is being lived out.</p>
<p>This is not a church without challenges, or brokenness, or pain.  But there is still something beautiful about what God has done here for more than a century, and what He is still doing.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">

                    
        
<p><a href="/images/2011/10/either_or.png"><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-265" height="187" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="/images/2011/10/either_or-300x187.png" srcset="/images/2011/10/either_or-300x187.png 300w, /images/2011/10/either_or-480x300.png 480w, /images/2011/10/either_or.png 640w" title="either_or" width="300" /></a>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma">Prisoner’s Dilemma</a> is a contrived game popular among mathematicians, used to model aspects of cooperation or conflict between individuals.</p>
<p>A<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_dilemma"> False Dilemma</a> is the presentation of two alternatives as being absolute and exclusive.</p>
<p>I think that we frequently become prisoners of false dilemmas.</p>
<p>We have a tendency to categorize people.  We like to put people in nice little boxes.  Often these boxes represent a binary Either/Or choice.  You are ‘liberal’ or ‘conservative’.  You are ‘christian’ or ‘atheist’.  You are ‘Mac’ or ‘PC’.</p>
<p>The danger of these labels is that they frequently represent a false dilemma: they assume that there are only two options, and that these options are mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>Perhaps you live in Northern Ireland, and it’s assumed that you’re either Protestant or Catholic.  But maybe you’re neither?  Maybe your agnostic, or Hindu?  Or maybe you consider yourself part of the ‘<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic">catholic</a>‘ (or universal) church, yet still feel there are church practices that need to be protested?  Or perhaps you consider yourself a ‘Protestant’, but don’t really feel like protesting all that much?</p>
<p>Or take political labels.  All too often I see political dialog reduced to a polarised conservative-liberal axis, as if there are only two possible stances on any political issue.  But what if we want to be both?  Maybe want to be conservative, in that I think there are many good things that should be conserved, or preserved.  And yet at the same time maybe I like the idea of being generous, which is after all a synonym for liberal.</p>
<p>Is it possible to transcend these labels?</p>
<p>Perhaps I can be a skeptic <em>and</em> a believer.  Maybe trust and curiosity can walk hand in hand.</p>
<p>Maybe I can be a Christian <em>and</em> a secularist.   What if I have strongly held religious convictions and yet still want to live in a society that doesn’t enforce a particular dogma, that creates space for people of all persuasions?</p>
<p>Fortunately, as a Canadian I live in a country where many of our discussions involve a plurality rather than a duality.  We have several viable political parties at the federal and provincial level.  Although our history has included binary contrasts such as French/English, Catholic/Protestant, we’re now a multicultural, diverse society, and as such it’s harder to lock people into small boxes.   It’s harder to see race, for example, in binary terms when your family is English-French-Norwegian-German, or your friends are Polish-Trinidadian-Canadian.</p>
<p>So let’s not allow ourselves to be locked in boxes.  And let’s take care not to force others into this Either/Or duality either.   Someone may disagree with you on one issue, but that doesn’t automatically put them in the ‘Other’ box, and make them your life-long opponent.</p>
<p>And as for me, I shall continue to proudly be a liberal, conservative,  skeptic, believing, questioning, hoping, geeky, athletic individual.</p>
<p>I’ll even reject the Mac/PC conflict, and happily use both, with a fair helping of Linux thrown into the mix.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">

                    
        
<p>I guess this posts is part of my ‘church crawl’ series as well as my ‘unanswered questions’ one.  It’ll be short, because the question doesn’t really need to be fleshed out.  It’s very simple.</p>
<p><em>What is the mission of the church?</em></p>
<p>Maybe you can help me answer this.  Some other ways of looking at this question might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why does your church exist?</li>
<li>What is it trying to achieve?</li>
<li>How do you measure ‘success’?</li>
<li>How does your church choose what activities to prioritise?</li>
<li>What are common goals that your church is working towards with other churches in your city?</li>
<li>What are common goals that your denomination is working towards with others?</li>
<li>If someone was wondering whether they should be part of a church at all, what would you say to them?  Do you think it’s important?  Why?</li>
<li>Is the church making progress in her mission?  What impediments exist? What tools are helping?</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe this is a question I should be asking as I visit churches in Barrie.  For now, I’d love to hear people’s opinions and suggestions.  Is there a common mission that applies to all the churches in the city?  What are your thoughts?</p>

                <div class="entry-content">

                    
        
<p><a href="/images/2011/10/IMG_00000023.jpg"><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-257" height="168" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="/images/2011/10/IMG_00000023-300x168.jpg" srcset="/images/2011/10/IMG_00000023-300x168.jpg 300w, /images/2011/10/IMG_00000023-1024x575.jpg 1024w, /images/2011/10/IMG_00000023-500x280.jpg 500w" title="IMG_00000023" width="300" /></a>Some churches let you slip in and out anonymously when you attend.  They avoid the threat of social interactions by studiously ignoring newcomers and by making sure there are no impediments  such as coffee or biscuits to you making a swift exit once the service is done.</p>
<p>Not so Barrie Covenant church.  I was intercepted three times before I even made it to the coffee hatch.  I was greeted, welcomed, and by the time I’d finished my coffee I’d been treated to a high level overview of the church, its denomination, its background, its history, its theological roots and its beliefs.</p>
<p>My initial impression was of a conservative, reserved, overwhelmingly white and predominantly older congregation.  But I soon realized that there was more to this church than that.  While this is probably one of the more traditional examples of this denomination, there is clearly a lot of thought going in to what this church is and where it is going.</p>
<p>Those I spoke to were interested in my journey and my questions, and able to give cohesive answers.  I always ask <em>who are you?</em>  I want to know the strengths of each church in the city, what makes them special, why they exist, and how they contribute to the spiritual life of the whole city.  This church, I was told, has its roots in the Dutch reformed movement.  It’s largely composed of second and third generation Dutch immigrants.  It’s theology is strongly influenced by the works of Calvin, and is formally grounded in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostles%27_Creed">Apostles</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicene_Creed">Nicene Creed</a>, and in the <a href="Heidelberg_Catechism">Heidelberg Catechism</a>, the <a href="http://www.reformed.org/documents/BelgicConfession.html">Belgic Confession</a> and the <a href="Canons_of_Dort">Canons of Dort</a>.  I’ve rarely been in a church where the ‘man in the pew’ can so succinctly and comprehensively review the doctrine and theology of his congregation.</p>
<p>As to what God is doing in the city, several things were mentioned when I asked.  <a href="www.barriechristiancouncil.org ">Barrie Christian Council</a>, <a href="http://bchlhockey.net/">Barrie Christian Hockey League</a>, <a href="http://www.lifeonline.fm/">Life 100 radio station</a>, and <a href="http://www.unitychristianhigh.ca/home.html">Unity Christian High School</a>.  Interestingly, these are all examples of inter-church initiatives.   I got the strong impression that although the CRC denomination may have been somewhat insular in the past, it is trying very hard now to figure out how it plays a healthy and complementary role alongside other churches.</p>
<p>I wish them all the best as they continue to figure out their mission.</p>

                <h2><a href="/2011/10/12/church-7-barrie-free-methodist/">Church 7 – Barrie Free Methodist</a></h2>
                
                
                <div class="entry-content">

                    
        
<p><a href="http://www.bfmc.org/"><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-228" height="169" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="/images/2011/10/barrie_free_methodist-300x169.jpg" srcset="/images/2011/10/barrie_free_methodist-300x169.jpg 300w, /images/2011/10/barrie_free_methodist-1024x579.jpg 1024w, /images/2011/10/barrie_free_methodist-500x282.jpg 500w" title="barrie_free_methodist" width="300" />This</a> is the biggest church I’ve attended so far on my ‘<a href="http://renaissancenow.ca/barrie-church-crawl/" title="Barrie Church Crawl">church crawl</a>.’  I’d guess that there were at least 250 people at the service on Sunday, and apparently this was a smaller than usual crowd due to it being Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>I wasn’t familiar with the denominational history of the ‘Free’ Methodist movement, and despite getting two different (and somewhat contradictory) accounts of its history at coffee time before the service I still don’t feel I can provide an accurate portrayal of its distinctives, or how it differs from any other Methodist church.</p>
<p>According to one of the members that I met, the Free Methodist church has an emphasis on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arminianism">Arminian</a> theology, and would see itself as being similar to a Wesleyan or Nazarene church.  That said, I didn’t really observe anything in the service that would be out of place in any other Canadian evangelical or baptist church.</p>
<p>The service itself was a very polished affair.  We were led in several songs by a very tight band – any of its members could easily be a session musician.  Unlike several churches I’ve been at the congregation joined in enthusiastically, and even if the music felt like a performance sometimes, space was also left for our voices as well.</p>
<p>Pastor John-Mark gave the sermon, taking about half an hour to talk about worship.  His delivery was engaging and precise, and although he didn’t have anything particularly earth-shattering to say, when I got to talk to him after the service I got the feeling that he’s someone who is thinking hard about the mission of the church in general and this congregation in particular, and who wants to work out practical ways of calling Christians to discipleship.</p>
<p>I left Barrie Free Methodist with a couple of impressions.  Firstly, I suspect that if you are an established member, this is a very warm, friendly and supportive community that takes its mission seriously.  However, if you’re an outsider, I wouldn’t be surprised if it took quite a long time to be fully accepted into the family.</p>
<p>Finally, I left with the realisation that I’m still struggling to understand exactly what the <em>mission</em> of the Church is.  What is Church for?  Why do we go every week?  What is the Church trying to achieve, and how will we know that we’re achieving it?  I’ll investigate this further in a subsequent post.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">

                    
        
<p><a href="/images/2011/10/IMG_9872.jpg"><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-234" height="199" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="/images/2011/10/IMG_9872-300x199.jpg" srcset="/images/2011/10/IMG_9872-300x199.jpg 300w, /images/2011/10/IMG_9872-1024x682.jpg 1024w, /images/2011/10/IMG_9872-450x300.jpg 450w, /images/2011/10/IMG_9872.jpg 1280w" title="IMG_9872" width="300" /></a>So, having visited the first seven churches of my church crawl, maybe now is a good time to take stock.  What have I noticed so far?</p>
<p>Well, the first, and most obvious thing is this: there are a lot of different churches in Barrie.</p>
<p>Ok, not a blindingly original insight.  But it does lead to some interesting questions.  Many of the churches I have visited have been keen to tell me about their history, their ‘distinctives’, and how they are different from other churches.  Sometimes, I’m sure out of genuine concern for my spiritual health, I’ve been warned against attending certain other churches as I continue this journey.</p>
<p>So, why so much variety?  Does Barrie need a United church, a Free Presbyterian one, or a Free Methodist or Catholic or Pentecostal church?</p>
<p>I’m currently reading Brian McLaren’s “<a href="http://brianmclaren.net/archives/books/brians-books/">A New Kind of Christianity.</a>”   In his chapter on the church, he says this about the plurality of church forms that exist today:</p>
<p><em>“Some see this as a <strong>division</strong> to be remedied, but there’s another way to see it: as <strong>diversification</strong> to be celebrated.  What if the Christian faith is <strong>supposed to </strong>exist in a variety of forms?”</em></p>
<p><em></em>I think that’s a good question.  What do you think?  Does the church in Barrie benefit from having so many different forms and traditions?  Or is it a sad division that needs to be healed?  Is there ‘one true way’ of doing church, or am I witnessing some of the broad range of valid approaches?</p>
<p>Is this even the right question?   Are there more important issues that go deeper than external appearances and behaviours?  Should I be exploring how the different expressions of church in Barrie challenge or complement one another?</p>
<p>Let me know what you think!  Maybe you attend one of the churches I’ve visited, or will be visiting.  Maybe you can help me understand better the strengths of your particular approach, or maybe you can tell me how I should feel about the wide range of church styles I’ve seen so far.</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you!</p>

<p>Of course you have.  He’s very famous for his ability to walk around a leafy green environment and hit little white balls into holes.  He’s won a number of the competitions that he’s entered.  He’s also earned millions in prize money and sponsorship deals.</p>
<p>Another question.  Have you heard of Chrissie Wellington?</p>
<p>Maybe not.  Chrissie is also an athlete.  On Saturday she got up very early in the morning, swam 4 kilometers in the Pacific Ocean, biked 180 kilometers over the  lava plains of Hawai, and then finished up with a 42 kilometer marathon run.</p>
<p>Chrissie races Ironman.</p>
<p>And while Tiger Woods has won a lot of competitions, no one has <em>ever</em> beaten Chrissie.</p>
<p>Think about that.  She has entered 13 iron-distance races, perhaps the most gruelling 1-day event in sport.  And she has won every single time.  On Saturday she won the Ironman World Championship in Hawaii for the fourth time, nearly beating the course record that she set two years ago.<br />
Oh, and before she started this career she worked to bring water and sanitation to countries affected by conflict.</p>
<p>So, if you want an athlete to be inspired by, you could do a lot worse than Wellington.  The first thing she said after crossing the finish line on Saturday was to dedicate her win to her nearest competitor, Mirinda Carfrae, in honour of how hard she had pushed the pace in the baking Hawaii heat.</p>
<p>Now that is serious class.</p>
