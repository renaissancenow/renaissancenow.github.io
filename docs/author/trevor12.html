                <div class="entry-content">

                    
        
<p><a href="/images/2012/06/IMG_00000150.jpg"><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-566" height="168" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="/images/2012/06/IMG_00000150-300x168.jpg" srcset="/images/2012/06/IMG_00000150-300x168.jpg 300w, /images/2012/06/IMG_00000150-1024x575.jpg 1024w" title="IMG_00000150" width="300" /></a>This Sunday I visited <a href="http://mapleview.cc/">Mapleview Community Church</a>.</p>
<p>I have less to say about this one than some others, not least because I didn’t really get the chance to talk to anybody.  Despite hanging around for 10 minutes after the service, no one introduced themselves to me, so unfortunately I have to score Mapleview a little low on the ‘friendliness’ scale.  I did see lots of other interactions between people though, so I expect it is a friendly community if you are an ‘insider’.</p>
<p>So, first impressions.  Mapleview meets in a large, new, purpose-built building near Essa and Mapleview.    The meeting room seems designed for warehouse concerts, and the service is well-attended, slickly organised, and loud.  Stylistically they are probably closest to <a href="http://www.connexuscommunity.com/">Connexus</a> out of the other churches in the city.</p>
<p>Mapleview is enthusiastically embracing modern technology.  The announcements were delivered in the form of a short video, and as the service started we were encouraged to ‘tweet’ our presence to our social networks.  This is also the first church I’ve been in that has a public WiFi network that I could connect to. The service I attended can in fact be viewed in full on Vimeo at  <a href="http://vimeo.com/44663738">http://vimeo.com/44663738</a>.</p>
<p>On reflection, I quite like this trend.   One of the main points of this church crawl is to encourage greater communication and dialog between the churches of the city.   If blogging, tweeting and facebook-ing encourage this conversation, then I’m all in favour.</p>
<p>Of course, these tools aren’t perfect.  One of the risks of social media is that we can, just like in meatspace, surround ourselves with voices that we agree with.  If I only ever listen to voices within my cultural, religious, and political tradition, I will mistakenly assume that the whole world agrees with me. I will only ask certain questions, and only consider certain answers.  History provides us with many painful examples of what happens when a culture collapses in on itself and refuses to see those outside as being fully human.</p>
<p>My hope is that we can have the courage to step beyond our comfort zones and engage in conversation with those who are different from us.   If you consider yourself politically left wing, try reading some articles from <a href="http://www.economist.com/">The Economist</a>.  If you’re right wing, leaf through <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world">The Guardian</a> occasionally.  If you mostly consume Canadian news, try <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/">Al Jazeera</a>‘s  exceptional global reporting some time.  Read some religious blogs outside your church tradition.  Try <a href="http://www.internetmonk.com/">Internet Monk</a>, or <a href="http://rachelheldevans.com/">Rachel Held Evans</a> or <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/slacktivist/">Fred Clark</a>.</p>
<p>And then engage in dialog.  In Barrie we’re lucky to have some quite fascinating <a href="http://www.davidstemple.com/Events/DiscussionNights.htm">discussion nights organised through David’s Temple</a>.   Over the past few months we’ve had some wonderful opportunities for dialog across political, cultural and religious divides.</p>
<p>I hope to see this continue, and I’m glad that Mapleview is taking these opportunities to connect digitally to the broader community.</p>

                <h2><a href="/2012/06/24/church-33-barrie-victory-centre/">Church 33 – Barrie Victory Centre</a></h2>
                
                
                <div class="entry-content">

                    
        
<p>I haven’t visited very many overtly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charismatic_Movement">charismatic</a> churches in my church crawl yet, so I began to redress this imbalance on Thursday night with a visit to <a href="http://www.barrievictory.org/">Barrie Victory Centre</a>.  <a href="/images/2012/06/IMG_00000148.jpg"><img alt="" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-560" height="150" src="/images/2012/06/IMG_00000148-150x150.jpg" title="IMG_00000148" width="150" /></a></p>
<p>I suppose it’s odd that we even have a distinction between charismatic/non charismatic.  Let’s face it, it’s an inescapable fact that the gospels are absolutely chock full of wild, crazy, supernatural stuff.</p>
<p>Think about the book of Mark.  We encounter the first miracle <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+1&amp;version=NIV">halfway into the first chapter</a>.   In fact, a quick review reveals that every single one of the first eleven chapters of Mark describes at least one miracle.  Jesus heals people.  Jesus controls the forces of nature.  Jesus performs exorcisms, and even brings dead people back to life.</p>
<p>If all we had was the Gospel of Mark, we would have to assume that Christianity was about little else than healing, deliverance, and miracles.</p>
<p>Strangely, though, I haven’t actually heard much talk of this in most of the churches that I’ve visited so far.  One church even managed to preach an entire thirty minute sermon about Mark 1:29-34 without ever once mentioning the supernatural nature of the healings and exorcism that the passage talks about.</p>
<p>However, there <em>are </em>churches that talk about little else.  Barrie Victory Centre, for example.</p>
<p>Now, to be perfectly honest, there were a number of things that made me uncomfortable on Thursday night.   The sermon went on for 90 minutes and I have no idea what it was meant to be about.  I took pages of notes, and even after reviewing them now I still can’t figure out what the structure or intent of the talk was supposed to be.</p>
<p>What did stick in my mind ranged from<a href="/images/2012/06/IMG_00000149.jpg"><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-559" height="300" sizes="(max-width: 168px) 100vw, 168px" src="/images/2012/06/IMG_00000149-168x300.jpg" srcset="/images/2012/06/IMG_00000149-168x300.jpg 168w, /images/2012/06/IMG_00000149-575x1024.jpg 575w, /images/2012/06/IMG_00000149.jpg 1456w" title="IMG_00000149" width="168" /></a> the unfortunate (such as carrying around a whip for the entire sermon as a bizarre visual aid) to the downright dangerous (such as claiming that ‘Real Christians’ will never experience depression or burnout.)</p>
<p>The large and rather disconcerting banner at the front of the church portraying heavily armed soldiers and helicopters like something out of <em>Apocalypse Now</em> didn’t help either.</p>
<p>However, this is also a genuinely warm and friendly bunch of people.  Many folks greeted me before and after the service, and I had a pleasant chat with the pastor and other members of the the congregation.   And I’m actually very much in favour of the charismatic movement: some of my most formative Christian experiences have been in charismatic churches, and I find that they bring a dimension to our shared faith that is frequently missing in other churches.</p>
<p>On reflection, I suspect that the main problem here is dis-connectedness.  Other churches in Barrie could benefit from Victory’s expectation that the Holy Spirit is tangibly active in our community today.  Likewise, Victory could perhaps benefit from  a Christian Reformed approach to vigorous exegesis, or the Salvation Army’s practical approach to serving the local community.</p>
<p>By her own admission, Victory is not particularly connected to the other churches in the city, and this is unfortunate.  I’d love to see the mutual benefits that would happen if our charismatic churches engaged more fully with those whose emphasis is liturgy, social action, or theological reflection.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">

                    
        
<p>I love the idea of house church.   I expect that house churches tend to get less attention than they deserve.  By their very nature they tend to fly under our radars; they have no buildings, no staff, no marketing and no billboards.  But so far the house church experiences that I’ve had in Barrie have been very positive.</p>
<p>This Sunday at ‘<a href="http://www.thechurchatmyplace.org/The_Church_at_My_Place/Home.html">The Church at My Place’</a> was no exception.  Just a handful of people meeting in a pleasant, upscale home to drink coffee, sing, discuss a passage from the bible, and take communion together.</p>
<p>I was warmly welcomed, and indeed my only real criticism would be the use of ‘<a href="http://www.iworshipnow.com/">iWorship</a>‘ videos.  I’m not a big fan of these, whether in a mega-church or a living room, because they feel too much like a crutch.  I’m worried that we use multimedia technology because it is easier and safer than doing the work of liturgy ourselves.</p>
<p>Creating our own music might not sound so polished, and might take more work, and it might take time for us to become comfortable with it, but that’s kind of the point.</p>
<p>You see I believe that church,  just like childhood, should be about a process of growing and working towards maturity.</p>
<p>In fact, I have an interesting thought experiment to help you see how well your church might be doing in this area.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Imagine what would happen if one Sunday I walked into your church and pulled 20 people at random from the congregation.  No-one from the platform, just regular churchgoers.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>And then imagine that I took them to a different city, and asked them to plant a church.</em></p>
<p>Could they do it?  Would they have the necessary ministry gifts?  Would they be able to learn, to pray, to grow?  What challenges would they face?  Would they be able to do it at all?</p>
<p>And if not, does that mean that our churches are not expecting people to reach maturity?</p>
<hr />
<p><em>The Church at My Place</em> has chosen to follow the <a href="http://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/">lectionary</a> for its readings, which I think is a nice touch.  It provides a sense of connection with the broader church, which could easily be a challenge for a very small group like this one.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, the passage for this week was <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Samuel+8&amp;version=NIV">1 Samuel 8</a>, one I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about.  This is a  passage about the failure of civic institutions, and the universal human tendency to look for strong leader-figures to follow.</p>
<p>Samuel warns the people of Israel who are demanding a strong ruler that a king will mistreat them, tax them, send them to war, and ultimately enslave them.  The people, however, reply “<em>No! We are determined to have a king over us, so that we also may be like other nations, and that our king may govern us and go out before us and fight our battles.</em>”</p>
<p>Most of us want to know that we belong to a tribe, and that we have a leader we can look up to who will ‘go out before us and fight our battles’.<br />
It might be the country we live in, or the company we work for, or the church we belong to, but this human need for identity and safety within a group is very strong.</p>
<p>However, on Sunday we also read the words of St. Paul where he reminds us that there is ‘<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+4&amp;version=NIV">One body, one hope, one Lord</a>‘.  That as Christians, we look ultimately to Christ for leadership, rather than human authority figures.</p>
<p>These are words that are very close to my heart.  As I visit the different expressions of the church in the city, I have to keep reminding myself that there is, indeed, ‘one body’.</p>
<p>What would this mean in practice?  What would it look like for the churches in Barrie to relate to each other as parts of the same body?  Will it ever be possible for a Catholic priest and a Baptist pastor and an Orthodox lay-person and a Gospel Hall member to break bread and pray together?</p>
<p>We might have to bend some rules.  And we might need to take some risks.  And we might need to step out of our comfort zone a bit.  But I am convinced that this is what we are called to do.</p>

<p>I find this fascinating.  Globally, it is clear that in many ways we have a fractured and broken economic system, a fragile ecology that is facing many challenges, and likewise a fracture ecumenism.</p>
<p>These are all related.  <em>Economics</em> is the way we choose to structure and order the world that we all share.  <em>Ecology</em>  is our effort to understand our shared environment: every life form, every eco-system, and the complex and beautiful relationships between them.  And <em>ecumenism</em> is our attempts to figure out how we as broken and divided members of the family of faith can live together, bless one another, and <a href="http://renaissancenow.ca/2011/10/12/division-or-diversification/" title="Division or Diversification?">celebrate our diversity rather than cling to our divisions</a>.</p>
<p>I  am convinced that as a society one of our biggest failings is our failure of imagination.  As we think about economics, the only question we seem capable of asking is ‘<a href="http://renaissancenow.ca/2011/08/30/question-1-is-gdp-a-good-measure-of-a-countrys-health/" title="Question 1 – is GDP a good measure of a country’s health?">how can we make more stuff?</a>‘   This is, after all, the definition of a growing economy.  The financial press is full of charts showing rates of GDP, and worrying about output and productivity and interest rates and bond defaults.   What if, instead, we chose to ask ourselves ‘how can we build a healthy and sustainable world, with freedom, peace and opportunity for all?’</p>
<p>Then we’d really have to start looking at our ecology, our economy, and our ecumenism.  Because we all share this <em>oikos</em>, this house, this world.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">I listened this evening to part of<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2012/05/31/ecuador-chveron-canada.html"> CBC’s story about the $18 billion dollar judgement for pollution in Ecuador that Chevron is still fighting</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cbc.ca/gfx/images/news/photos/2012/05/31/li-620-chevron-ecuador-oil.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter" height="209" src="http://www.cbc.ca/gfx/images/news/photos/2012/05/31/li-620-chevron-ecuador-oil.jpg" width="372" /></a>As a representative of the indigenous Ecuadorans discussed the lack of environmental controls in place at the time, and the huge legal challenges that they had had to go through to even get the case heard, it struck me that perhaps one of our problems is that we forget that <em>corporations are people.</em></p>
<p>Not in the sense of Corporate Personhood, but that every enterprise, organisation, business or corporation is made up of individual human beings.  ‘Chevron’ may be refusing to take responsibility for the ecological disaster it has created, but this is merely the aggregate behavior of a group of individual employees.  Forty years ago real, living, breathing people decided that an Ecuador drilling operation didn’t need the same environmental safeguards that would be required in North America.  Today, real, living, breathing human beings will get up, eat breakfast, and then go to work on drafting legal arguments explaining why no further effort needs to be made to clean up the mess created by the dumping of 18 billion gallons of oil-contaminated water.</p>
<p>The ‘limited liability’ nature of the modern corporation may well <em>legally</em> protect shareholders and executives from unlimited prosecution, but it cannot protect them <em>morally</em> from culpability for their actions.</p>
<p>Rather than just talk about Chevron, or any number of other ethically-challenged corporations, perhaps we should talk about the real human beings who made and are still making the decision to treat the lives and livelihoods of those around them with contempt.</p>

I was glad to visit the day they were celebrating “<a href="http://www.presbyterian.ca/healing">Healing and Reconciliation Sunday</a>.”</p>
<p>Reconciliation is a concept that is very close to my heart.  It’s hard to  work your way around the churches of Barrie without realizing that there are some deep divisions on the family of God.   Some of these are recent rifts,  and some are centuries old conflicts that successive waves of immigrants have brought with them from the Old World.  Very often I’ll encounter groups who define themselves not so much by who they are, but by who they are <em>not</em>.</p>
<p>So it’s fitting to have a day set aside to think about reconciliation.  This is, after all, at the heart of the gospel we claim to follow: reconciliation between God and humanity, but also between fractured groups and individuals.   In <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:18&amp;version=ESV">2 Corinthians 5</a>, Paul reminds us that God has both reconciled us to himself, but also given us a ministry of reconciliation.  In <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20corinthians%2013&amp;version=ESV">1 Corinthians 13</a>, he highlights the primacy of love – something that has greater importance than any knowledge, gift or ability.   These and other verses framed the discussion of reconciliation presented at St. Andrew’s last week.</p>
<p>This was not purely a theoretical discussion.   The speaker admitted that the Presbyterian Church had suffered deep divisions in its recent past.  In 1925 the denomination split apart, with 60% joining the newly formed United church.  Congregations, missions, colleges and residential schools had to decide on which side of the divide they would belong. The speaker also took the opportunity to delve fearlessly into the church’s recent history with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Indian_residential_school_system">residential school system</a>.  This is obviously a large topic, and one which as a newcomer to Canada I’m still learning about.  It was good to hear the church recognize that in choosing to become an instrument of government policy in ‘civilizing’ aboriginal people, she had lost sight of her calling to love, understand and cherish the communities in which she worked.  It was also encouraging to hear about the work of the Truth and Reconciliation commission, and the various attempts that are being made to bring healing to past hurts.</p>
<p>I didn’t have much time to meet folks afterwards, but I did find it a friendly and welcoming congregation.  Lots of people greeted me on the way in and out.</p>
<p>All in all a good morning.  Reconciliation is not an easy topic.  It involves digging up past hurts and taking a long, painful look at our own behaviors and prejudices etc.   But despite that I’m convinced that it lies at the heart of the gospel, and I’m very glad to see a congregation deal honestly with the challenge of reconciliation.</p>

<p>As I travel around the city of Barrie and witness her different expressions of Christian community, I can’t help but think occasionally about the strange group of followers that Jesus gathered around himself.<br />
<a href="/images/2012/05/Leonardo_da_Vinci_Lultima_cena_1495_1497.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-531" height="163" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="/images/2012/05/Leonardo_da_Vinci_Lultima_cena_1495_1497-300x163.jpg" srcset="/images/2012/05/Leonardo_da_Vinci_Lultima_cena_1495_1497-300x163.jpg 300w, /images/2012/05/Leonardo_da_Vinci_Lultima_cena_1495_1497-1024x556.jpg 1024w" title="Leonardo_da_Vinci_Lultima_cena_1495_1497" width="300" /></a><br />
You might think, especially if you read a lot of books on ‘leadership’, that Jesus would have had a certain type of person in mind to carry out his mission and vision.  Someone who could take orders, but also take initiative, someone passionately devoted to his cause, a quick learner but but also a willing subordinate.  And with this ideal in mind, he might have recruited a number of like-minded people who would quickly learn the roles he had in mind for them.</p>
<p>Strangely, Jesus chose to do something completely different.</p>
<p>We are told in Mark 3 that Jesus hand-picked twelve followers from the large crowds that were flocking to his message. So, given that he had far more candidates available than positions to fill, why on earth did he choose such a strange, conflicted bunch?</p>
<p>Let’s consider the political situation at the time.  Jesus spent most of his life in ‘occupied territory.’   The situation in 1st century Palestine might seem very familiar to an inhabitant, say, of apartheid-era South Africa, or Soviet-occupied East Germany, or even present day occupied Palestinian territories.</p>
<p>The Jewish nation he grew up in had negotiated an uneasy peace with her Roman overlords, but the threat of violent oppression always remained.   Just like in occupied France during the Second World War,  different groups responded differently.</p>
<p>The Zealots, for example, advocated violent overthrow of the unwanted invaders.  Some might call them freedom fighters, others would call them terrorists.   The Sadducees, on the other hand,  were consummate politicians.  They obtained positions of power under the new regime, ran government departments on behalf of the empire,  as well as being responsible for the religious life of the country.</p>
<p>Another group, the Pharisees were more separatist in nature, focussing on maintaining ideological purity against external threats.  And finally the Essenes were a kind of monastic movement, choosing to focus inwards on communal, ascetic, living.</p>
<p>And into this complex, politically charged environment, Jesus started to talk about a new king, a new empire, a new way of life.  And to spread his message, he recruited a ‘team’ consisting of some very weird characters indeed.</p>
<p>There was Simon Peter, the laborer.   A leader, a hothead, just as quick to rush into situations as he was to desperately try to extricate himself from them when they got difficult.</p>
<p>Alongside him was his brother Andrew.  Very different in temperament, he was a devout spiritual seeker and evangelist.</p>
<p>Another contrasting pair of brothers was also recruited.   James, the fanatic, the troublemaker and eventual martyr; and his brother John, who devoted his life’s energies to calling the fledgling Christian community to live in love and harmony.</p>
<p>Yet more contrasts: we see James and Jude, traditional Jewish names, but also Philip, a Greek name, and someone who is recorded as connecting the Greek community to Jesus.  A mediator, perhaps, who could stand up for the needs of a minority community.</p>
<p>In Nathaniel, we see a devout, observant Jew.  In Thomas, we meet a fatalist and a skeptic, and yet also someone who, once he found the proof he needed of Christ’s claims, would travel further than any of his contemporaries to spread the message.</p>
<p>Stirring things up even more, Jesus saw fit to recruit Simon the ‘Zealot.’</p>
<p>Today, he’d either be known as ‘Simon the Patriot’ or ‘Simon the Terrorist’, depending on how you viewed the Roman occupation.   One person who would definitely use the latter term would be another recruit, Matthew.</p>
<p>Matthew, the tax collector.  Matthew, the tool of the occupation.  Matthew the collaborator.  The guy who had made a tidy profit from working hand in hand with the military force that Simon had dedicated his life to overthrowing.</p>
<p>I’m sure Simon and Matthew had very <em>intense</em> conversations around the campfire at night.  Maybe Jesus had a sufficiently mischievous streak to send them out together when he assigned the disciples to work in pairs?</p>
<p>And then, finally, Jesus recruited his team’s accountant.</p>
<p><em>Judas Iscariot.</em></p>
<p>It’s very clear that Jesus never read a book on management theory.</p>
<p>Whatever he was looking for in followers, it clearly wasn’t bland uniformity.</p>

<p>So, spring is here, the race calendar is beginning to fill up, and that can only mean one thing.</p>
<p>Yes, it’s time for interval training, the runner’s very own, personal, customized hell.</p>
<p><a href="/images/2012/05/IMG_00000129.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-520" height="168" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="/images/2012/05/IMG_00000129-300x168.jpg" srcset="/images/2012/05/IMG_00000129-300x168.jpg 300w, /images/2012/05/IMG_00000129-1024x575.jpg 1024w" title="IMG_00000129" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>Volume training –  the long, slow runs you do all winter, gives your body the endurance to complete a race.  Interval training gives it the speed to win.  Like a lot of runners, I don’t do speedwork year-round.  In the off-season I give my body time to recover, and work on running style and endurance.  But when the warm weather gets here, it’s time to learn how to suffer.</p>
<p>I have a loop in my subdivision that’s almost exactly a kilometer.  So, yesterday I went out and ran round it once.  Nice and slow, and taking the opportunity to drink a lot of water.  I’d be needing that.  First time round, 4 minutes and 24 seconds, a half-marathon kind of pace.</p>
<p>Six minutes after starting the first loop, I did it again.  4 minutes, 15 seconds this time.</p>
<p>Then again.  Down to 3:37.  Speeding up a little too much, better dial it back a bit.  Drink as much water as possible between repeats, breath deeply to get the heart rate down before it all starts over.</p>
<p>Next time,  3:57.  Bit more controlled.  Time to crank it up a bit.  On the six minute mark a started again.  Focus on breathing, keep lifting your heels, don’t tense up.  Let your body do the work.  3:29 this time.  Now we’re into fast race territory.</p>
<p>The six minute mark comes round again far too soon.  Off again – try to hold that same race pace.  3:28, hard but bearable.</p>
<p>Crank it up one more notch.  The next loop falls in  3:17.  Gasping for breath at the end, finish off my third water bottle.  Pour some of it over my head to cool off.   Pretty much maxing out, but I’m sure that heading out I was thinking ‘you know, I have one more gear in my legs…’</p>
<p>Ok, time for the hardest push.  Full throttle, no holding back.  On the six minute mark, start the watch and sprint to full pace.  At this point I can’t keep my legs relaxed, I can only think about breathing as hard as possible to keep the oxygen getting to my muscles and keeping my leg turnover high.</p>
<p>We get two things from interval training. One, of course, is teaching our body to move quickly.  But the other is getting used to pain.  When I’m in the final straight of a 5k race and my body is screaming to stop, I want to be able to tell myself ‘I’ve been here before.’  And I’m there now – cranking out a pace faster than I’ll ever do in a race.  My eyes start to close, I can’t see straight, I’ve got just enough concentration to veer round the kids playing in the road on the back straight.  Halfway round.  Three quarters.</p>
<p>I round the final bend, breathing on every other foot strike.  Try not to tense up, hold your stride, keep driving for the line.</p>
<p>I cross it in 3:09.  I manage to keep upright and head into the house for more water.  My wife is a little alarmed that my gasping for breath can be heard throughout the house and that I’m incapable of speech for several minutes, but personally I’m very satisfied that I’m only a few seconds down from my peak of last year.</p>
<p>Then after a drink I head out and do four more loops.</p>
<p>Welcome to spring.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">

                    
        
<p>Continuing with the Baptist stream, I attended First Baptist this morning.  This is located at the far east end of the city, and I understand that it has been around for about 12 years.</p>
<p>In short, I really liked it.  It reminded me of <a href="http://www.erindale.org/">Erindale Bible Chapel</a>, the church we attended when we were living in Mississauga.  The architecture, the relaxed, warm feel to the service, and the sense of family that the congregation exhibited all seemed pleasantly familiar.  I get the feeling that this is a group of people who genuinely enjoy getting together for worship on a Sunday.</p>
<p>Musically, the service was a mix – we sung some hymns to the accompaniment of an organ, interspersed with a couple of songs led by an enthusiastic praise band.</p>
<p>It’s no secret that I don’t usually enjoy sitting through sermons, but I did appreciate this one.  Not least, because the topic of the sermon was grace.  For some reason, this is a subject that we talk about surprisingly infrequently.</p>
<p>The speaker took half an hour or so to talk about several of the people that Jesus showed grace to: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+19%3A1-10&amp;version=NIV">Zaccheus</a>, the <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+8%3A1-11&amp;version=NIV">woman caught in adultery</a>, the <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%208:5-13;&amp;version=TNIV">Roman centurion</a>, and <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+21&amp;version=NIV">Simon Peter</a> after his rejection of Jesus. It’s interesting to me how Christ’s grace to these people both challenges the assumptions of those around him, but also led directly to transformation in the lives of the recipients.</p>
<p>In the words of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNjH8QDpBFY">song</a> we sang at the end of the sermon, “<em>your grace has found me just as I am…, forever I am changed by your love.”</em></p>
<p>I liked this church, and I’d be happy to recommend it to anyone living in that part of town.</p>
