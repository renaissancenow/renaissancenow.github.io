                <h2><a href="/2011/09/04/church-1-redwood-park/">Church 1 – Redwood Park</a></h2>
                
                
                <div class="entry-content">

                    
        
<p><a href="http://www.redwoodparkbarrie.org">Redwood Park Church</a> meets on Sunday mornings  at Emma King School.  Check it out if you live in Letitia heights – the people are friendly, coffee is served before, during and after the service, and the snacks they serve with it are to die for!</p>
<p>This is a small, informal group, there were more kids than adults when I attended, and I got a friendly welcome from nearly everyone in the building.   Before the service had even started I’d had a long chat with one member about the church’s mission, and with the pastor about youth ministry, the role of liturgy in worship, and the links between the emergent movement and Anglicanism.  I love a good theological discussion, so this was a good start.</p>
<p>The service itself I’ll call ‘classic school gymnasium church-plant’.  This style has its ups and downs regardless of the specific church.  School gyms are not built with acoustics in mind, and no matter how talented the musical leadership is, any sound system in an echoing gym will easily drown out unamplified voices.  From where I was sitting at the back, I couldn’t hear a single voice that wasn’t part of the music team.  I worry that we tend to see worship as something that we observe, rather than something that we do.  There is a big challenge for our churches to figure out how to create spaces that progressively draw people into active encounters with the divine.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://renaissancenow.ca/2011/09/04/seventy-three-churches-and-counting/" title="Seventy Three Churches and Counting">questions I’m asking</a> as I undertake this journey are “why are you here” and “what is God doing?”</p>
<p>Redwood Park exists, I was told, for a couple of reasons:  To provide a space for those that would otherwise not be able to find a church home, both ‘outsiders’ and those ‘heading out’.  It also wants to serve the less privileged areas around Anne St/Letitia Heights.</p>
<p>As to what God is doing in the city in general: answers I heard include churches in Barrie becoming less insular, and more outwardly focused, with a greater emphasis on serving the local community.</p>
<p>So, one down, seventy-two or so to go.</p>

<p><a href="/images/2011/09/churchsign1.jpg"><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-150" height="270" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="/images/2011/09/churchsign1-300x270.jpg" srcset="/images/2011/09/churchsign1-300x270.jpg 300w, /images/2011/09/churchsign1-333x300.jpg 333w, /images/2011/09/churchsign1.jpg 400w" title="churchsign" width="300" /></a>The city of Barrie has, as far as I can tell, 73 churches.</p>
<p>This year I intend to visit them all.</p>
<p>Now, you might ask yourself why I would voluntarily choose to sit through 73 sermons, when I could be catching up on sleep, or sitting in Second Cup, or organizing my filing cabinet.</p>
<p>As someone who’s avoided church as much as he could for the last year, and finds it almost impossible to sit through a sermon without either walking out or writing copious notes on each point that I disagree with, I’m even a little surprised myself that I’d choose to do this, but I do have some specific reasons.</p>
<p>I may be a harsh critic of the church, but deep down I do still believe that Christ loves her.  We followers of Christ may be fragmented, we may be argumentative, we may frequently get things wrong, but I believe that Christ sees beyond our denominational boundaries, our weaknesses and our failings, and cares for us and wants to work redemptively through us.</p>
<p>I also have some specific questions that I want to ask to the entire Christian community in Barrie:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>May I come in?</em>  What is really meant by that ‘All Welcome’ sign hanging outside?<br />
<em></em></li>
<li><em>What is God doing in the city?</em>  I am curious to see whether I will get one answer to this question, or 73.  Will the Ukrainian Orthodox give me the same answer as the Pentecostals?</li>
<li><em>Why is your church here?</em>  Again, I’m intrigued to see how broad a response I will get.  Will the pastor tell me the same thing as the guy sitting next to me in the pew?</li>
</ol>
<p>I suspect other questions will arise as I begin my visits – what would you ask the churches of your city if you had the chance?</p>

<p>Another tricky one today.  One time when I entered Canada I was asked whether I had ‘ever been affiliated with an organization that used violence to achieve political goals.’</p>
<p>I was very tempted to say ‘yes, I’m a British Citizen.’</p>
<p>I doubt that an immigration desk is the right place to have a detailed philosophical discussion about if and when it is acceptable to use violence to further political aims.  A border agent probably isn’t that interested in debating Just War theory, or pacifism, or the culpability of the citizen for the actions of the state, or Weber’s idea’s of the Monopoly on Violence.</p>
<p>However, this blog is <em>exactly</em> the right place to have that discussion.</p>
<p>So, when is it justifiable for one group to kill people for political reasons?  Karl van Clausewitz said that “War is the continuation of policy by other means”, and then spent 10 (surprisingly readable) volumes discussing the best ways of conducting war.  But he only considered the actions of nation-states.  In today’s world we have national armies, but also private security outfits, militant groups, and indeed lone individuals, all of whom have both political goals and the ability and motivation to harm others in order to achieve them.</p>
<p>Even categorizing these groups presents difficulties.  In Iraq, anti-government forces tend to be known as ‘insurgents.’  In Libya, anti-government forces are referred to as ‘rebels.’  Members of the African National Congress, such as Nelson Mandela, were referred to variously as revolutionaries, militants, freedom fighters and terrorists.  Even the language that we use carries a heavy weight of implied judgement, making it hard to objectively consider when and where violence may be justifiable.</p>
<p>So, is it acceptable for one nation to invade another to acquire resources, or perhaps in pre-emptive defence?  Is it OK to bomb or shoot a corrupt dictator?  If so, must the killer be part of an organized national army, or a distinct political group, or does the rightness of the cause permit a lone actor to take matters into their own hands?  What about the use of violence against citizens, or ideological groups, or criminals?</p>
<p>And if we can answer these questions, can we then mold them into a cohesive theory that applies both to the actions of the state but also to the responsibilities of the individual?</p>
<p>Today I will go to work, and some of the tax I pay on my income will be directed towards the Canadian armed forces.  As a direct result of my labors, bombs have been built, guns have been loaded, and ultimately, on the other side of the world, people I’ve never met have been killed.</p>
<p>How do we respond to this?  Is it possible, as a society, to agree on the place and limitations of political aggression?   And can we do so in a way that acknowledges and cherishes the fundamental value of each human life?</p>
<p> </p>

<p>GDP, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product">Gross Domestic Product</a>, is a measure of the economic output of a country.  It seems to be an unspoken assumption by nearly all economic commentators that more GDP is better than less.  If the GDP of a country declines, then we call that a recession.  If it grows, we call that a ‘healthy’ economy.  Indeed, we seem to use all sorts of anthropomorphic adjectives to describe the world of financial transactions.  Think about it:</p>
<p>The economy is struggling.  The economy is recovering.  The economy needs to be stimulated.  The economy is crippled. The economy is healthy.  The economy is at risk.  The economy is growing.</p>
<p>In fact, if we didn’t know what the word meant, we might hazard a guess that ‘The Economy’ is the name of a friend’s slightly wayward toddler.</p>
<p>Which brings me to my question.  A toddler, of course, should be growing – physically, emotionally, and intellectually.  But not all growth is good.  We are told that it is good for a country to experience continuous economic growth of a few percent every year.  But unrestrained, exponential growth of living cells is know by a different name.</p>
<p>We call it cancer.</p>
<p>If our industrial output grows at, lets say a nice conservative rate of 2 percent a year, then after 10 years we will be producing 21 percent more goods and services than when we started.</p>
<p>After a hundred years we will be producing seven times as much.</p>
<p>After a thousand years, we will be producing just shy of 400 million times as much.</p>
<p>Seriously.  Try the math.  Enter 1.02 to the power of 1000 in your calculator.  The answer is 398,264,651.</p>
<p>400 million times as many cars.  400 million times as many cell phones.  And filling 400 million times as many landfills.</p>
<p>Does your city have space for 400 million landfills?</p>
<p>And if not, then how <em>should</em> we measure the health of a country?</p>

<p>In theory, running should be the most undramatic of sports.  The requirements are simple; you turn up at the start line, and when the horn sounds you run the allotted distance to the finish, at whatever pace you are capable of maintaining.</p>
<p>However yesterday’s inaugural <a href="http://www.barriehalfmarathon.com/">Barrie Half Marathon</a> drove home the point to me that even a simple half-marathon can be a dramatic event. <a href="/images/2011/08/running_feet.jpg"><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-116" height="199" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="/images/2011/08/running_feet-300x199.jpg" srcset="/images/2011/08/running_feet-300x199.jpg 300w, /images/2011/08/running_feet-450x300.jpg 450w, /images/2011/08/running_feet.jpg 500w" title="running_feet" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>It started well, with the course taking us around Kempenfelt Bay on trails that I train on regularly.  This was home ground, and kept my breathing steady and my body loose.</p>
<p>The course brought us back past the start/finish line about half-way through the race.  I crossed the 10k marker enjoying the cheering crowds, running well and on pace to finish close to my personal best time.</p>
<p>A few minutes later I passed the 11k marker limping on knees that had suddenly refused to work.  My quads had tightened up and I my legs would only allow me to run a hundred metres or so before requiring me to stop, stretch, and walk.</p>
<p>So, I walked, limped and hobbled the next ten kilometers. This was a humbling experience for me – I’m used to experiencing races if not from the front, then at least from well up into the ‘business end’.  This time, first I watched the guys I’d been pacing out with vanish into the distance, and then most of the rest of the pack run past me.  At about 17k I was dropped by a guy with only one leg.</p>
<p>Now, this being running, <em>everyone</em> was supportive.  Practically every runner and volunteer called out encouragement or checked if I was OK.  And so, despite running probably the slowest race of my life, and crossing the line at two hours and five minutes, I finished.</p>
<p>And it was worth it.</p>

<p>I’ve thought for a long time that javascript is a horrible language with a wonderful language inside trying to get out.   Coffeescript may well be that language.  While at it’s heart it is still fundamentally javascript, and can be used anywhere javascript can (so far I’ve used it in <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a> and in the browser), it steers you around the worst mistakes of the underlying language.  Variable scoping and binding is handled better, function declarations are clearer, iterations and comprehensions are integrated neatly into the language, and your code can be more succinct.</p>
<p>This week I re-wrote our mobile web platform, replacing our existing jquery-ui based rendering with coffeescript and <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/">backbone</a>.  There was definitely a learning curve involved, but the effort was worthwhile; and now we have a code base that is considerably more manageable than the previous version.</p>
<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
<pre>l=[1,2,3]
square = (x) -&gt; x*x
squares = (square(x) for x in l)</pre>
<p>Or even</p>
<pre>squares = (x*x for x in [1,2,3])</pre>
<p>And from our actual code: we store data as json-encoded strings in the browser’s local storage.  This function takes a <em>predicate</em> (i.e. any function that returns a boolean) and uses it to find the keys of all elements in local storage that match.</p>
<pre>view : (predicate) -&gt;
    (key for own key,value of localStorage when predicate (JSON.parse(value))</pre>
<p>Which could then be used to get all objects that have a field ‘type’ set to ‘response’ as follows:</p>
<pre>dockeys = view (doc) -&gt; doc.type=='response'</pre>
<p>Neat, huh?   Head over to <a href="http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/">http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/</a> and try it out yourself!</p>

<p><em>“I took the CBC Political compass, and came up as Green. I like the Green platform, I agree with the Green party’s policies.  But I could never vote for them because it I can’t take the risk of voting for a third party and letting the Conservatives win.”</em></p>
<p>This represents to me one of the big misunderstandings of our political process.   We need to remind ourselves that we do not vote for parties, we vote for people.  We are not electing a prime minister, or a party, but a LOCAL representative.</p>
<p>Driving through the city I see lots of boards with peoples names on it.  So I know that Patrick Brown is ‘blue’, Colin Wilson is ‘red’, Myrna Clark  is ‘orange’ and so on, and I find myself wondering whether a person’s character can really be summed up by a an <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_colornames.asp">HTML colour code</a>.   Is Patrick Brown more interesting than <span style="color: #000080;">#00008B Dark Blue?</span> Surely Colin’s family knows that he has more depth of character than <span style="color: #ff0000;">#FF0000 Red</span>?</p>
<p>We elect people, not parties. As I’ve said before, and will say again, what matters is the competence and integrity of the individual.  I don’t know how I’ll vote yet on may 2nd, but I do know that I’ll make my decision based on my best assessment of the character and abilities of the candidates, not the color of their signs.  Anything less is to ignore the humanity of both the candidates and the people they represent.</p>

<p>The first, and so far only, election flyer that I’ve received is from <a href="http://colinwilson.ca/">Colin Wilson</a>.  It highlights Liberal values, such as “investing in programs that continue to reduce the crime rate, rather than building new prisons”, which I found a welcome contrast to Brown’s ‘<a href="http://renaissancenow.ca/2011/03/29/federal-election-day-4/" title="Federal Election Day 4">tough on crime</a>‘ stance.  It also included an invitation to “drop by the office to have a chat with Collin”, so that’s exactly what I did.</p>
<p>My impression?  So far, top marks for Colin and his team.  Despite having to prepare for a debate this evening, Colin graciously took the time to meet me and answer some of my questions.   As I’ve said repeatedly, <a href="http://renaissancenow.ca/2011/01/09/canadas-hr-department/" title="Canada’s HR Department"><em>competence</em> and <em>integrity</em></a> are two values that are critical for any political candidate.  Colin mentioned to me both his 12 years of experience managing project teams in the private sector and his 10 years working in government.   He can certainly reasonably claim the experience and competence to be an effective MP.</p>
<p>Colin also has a desire to bring high-tech and green jobs to Barrie.  The city certainly needs a concerted effort in this area, and it will be interesting to see what definitive proposals are developed to help the city continue it’s transition from an industrial to a knowledge-based economy.</p>
<p>As the Barrie Examiner <a href="http://www.thebarrieexaminer.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=3052043">pointed out last week</a>, running an election campaign can be an expensive  process, but so far it seems that it’s a challenge that Colin and his team are tackling with gusto.</p>
<p>If you want a chance to hear and meet the candidates, the next debate is on the 14th at <a href="http://barriechamber.com/BookingRetrieve.aspx?ID=131660">Barrie City Hall</a>.  Democracy only works if the electorate engages actively, so come and let your voice be heard.</p>
