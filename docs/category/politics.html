                <h2><a href="/2015/08/22/another-year-another-election/">Another year, another election</a></h2>
                
                
                <div class="entry-content">

                    
        
<p>Our local Conservative candidate just came by to ask for my support, so I guess we’re in an election cycle again.  While these can be divisive and angry events, I still deeply believe in representative democracy, and I welcome the opportunity that the election season represents to discuss policy, leadership, and the kind of country we want to have.</p>
<p>I’m well aware that we’ve already had our first leadership debate and weeks of advertising, but so far I’ve chosen to ignore most of this activity.  Firstly, I’m a completely content cord-cutter, so I am rarely exposed to ‘push’ advertising.  The parties may be spending millions to promote their image and attack their opponents, but as far as I’m concerned this is completely wasted money.  My children, reared on Netflix, find it deeply strange that people tolerate a TV show being interrupted by a paid commercial, and I completely agree with them.   This perhaps is of the defining conflicts  of our age.  On one side we have commercial interests  trying to buy our eyeballs and our attention, and on the other we have all of us who are trying to maintain ownership and autonomy over our own mental environment.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_1348" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/cities/gallery/2015/aug/12/tokyo-without-ads-japan-stripped-bare-in-pictures"><img alt="noads" class="wp-image-1348 size-medium" height="200" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="/images/2015/08/noads-300x200.jpeg" srcset="/images/2015/08/noads-300x200.jpeg 300w, /images/2015/08/noads-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, /images/2015/08/noads-620x413.jpeg 620w" width="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">http://www.theguardian.com/cities/gallery/2015/aug/12/tokyo-without-ads-japan-stripped-bare-in-pictures</p></div>
<p>So for that reason I happily embrace cord-cutting and ad-blocking, why I listen to CBC or change the channel the moment a commercial comes on, and why I find it deeply weird whenever I’m in a hotel lobby with a television blaring.  I want to <em>choose</em> what goes into my head: how, when, and in what format.</p>
<p>So the parties can continue to spend millions, and I’ll continue to be completely unaffected.  Because the conversation that the parties want to draw me into is not the one I want to have.  At this point, I’m not actually interested in the personality of the party leaders, but I want to use this moment to think about the kind of policies and leadership that I want for this country.  And it may well be that the really important issues that we need to be talking about aren’t the same as the ‘wedge’ issues that the parties will seize upon to distinguish themselves from their competition.</p>
<p>None of which is to imply that I don’t want to be informed, but I intend to start this election cycle figuring what truly matters first, and then do my own research on what the parties and candidates have to offer.</p>
<p> </p>

<blockquote><p>“Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time”</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">Winston Churchill</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">Tomorrow we go to the polls.  As of right now, I’m still undecided as to who I will vote for.  But I do know a few things for sure.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I’m glad that I live in Ontario.  Yesterday, up to 500,000 people were forced to <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-25588623">flee</a> Mosul in the wake of sectarian attacks.   Here, our political candidates have been trading verbal barbs.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In China, the government has been engaged in a massive exercise to <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/04/tiananmen-square-online-search-censored">remove</a> all mention of the Tiananmen Square massacre from online discussion.  Here, I’ve been able to engage in email and Twitter conversations with several party candidates, and express my political frustrations quite freely on Facebook and on my blog.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In Syria, a civil war has been ongoing for the past three years, destroying homes, infrastructure, lives, and hope.  Hear, we experience one of the highest standards of living in the world, excellent healthcare, opportunities for social mobility, vast natural resources, and a peaceful society.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">On Friday, we will have a new Provincial government.  Some people will be happy.  Others will be deeply disappointed.   The new government will, certainly, get some things wrong.  They <em>will</em> mismanage funds, there <em>will</em> be political scandals, taxes will not be as low as we might like, and there will not be the funding for every social programming that we think is deserving.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But despite all that, we will still have a functional, representative, democratically elected government.  My MPP will still be someone who lives in my city, who walks the same streets as I do, who I can actually reach out and speak to.  We will still have functioning schools, hospitals, roads, emergency services, and provincial parks.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We have these things because countless ordinary Canadians worked tirelessly for generations to build these institutions.  I’m glad for all the people from every party who think that the future of Ontario is worth fighting for, and who have engaged in this round of political discussion.  And regardless of who ‘wins’ tomorrow, I hope that every Ontarian wins, and gets a government that will continue to work for the best interests of the entire province.</p>

                <h2><a href="/2014/06/10/a-letter-in-the-mail/">A Letter in the Mail</a></h2>
                
                
                <div class="entry-content">

                    
        
<p>After having spent days complaining about the lack of engagement in genuine conversation from our politicians, I feel duty bound to celebrate when one of them talks to me. <a href="https://twitter.com/RodneyJackson">Rod Jackson</a>, our PC candidate and the current MPP for Barrie, responding to my tweets with an invitation to discuss things further via email; and then sent me a page-long message with specific responses to each issue I raised with him.  Frankly, I’m impressed.  For him (or even for one of his staff) to take the time to engage directly with a single voter in the week before the campaign is a good indication of politician who actually takes his role as a <em>representative</em> seriously.</p>
<p>I certainly don’t see eye-to-eye with his party on every issue, but as I’ve said before, I deeply believe that we should be sending people with <strong>competence</strong> and <strong>integrity</strong> to Queen’s Park.  The ability to run an efficient campaign is actually a pretty good test of the former.  I’ve yet to formulate a satisfactory test for the latter, unfortunately – I suspect it requires taking a lot of time to actually get to know our candidates as people.</p>
<hr />
<p>There’s been a lot of talk this year about ‘declining your vote.’  This is pretty much the only option that voters have for expressing their dissatisfaction with the available candidates in a way that actually gets counted.  Whether anything is <em>done</em> with that count is open to debate.  It’s certainly better than not voting at all, and probably worse than voting for a third-party candidate.  But either way, I’d much rather say ‘this is the person I want to represent me’ than ‘what can I do to stop <em>that</em> person from representing me.’ In an ideal world, as a voter I’d feel like an HR manager at a successful, popular candidate, interviewing a number of talented, qualified candidates, and having to pick the one who would be the absolute best fit.    Part of the problem is that a vote only records a tiny amount of information – a single check in a single box.  If there are 4 candidates in the riding, that information could be encoded in 2 bits.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<pre>Candidate A: 00</pre>
<pre>Candidate B: 01</pre>
</li>
<li>
<pre>Candidate C: 10</pre>
</li>
<li>
<pre>Candidate D: 11</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Which can only go so far in capturing the hopes, fears, aspirations and concerns of the average voter.  This is why we need to be engaged politically beyond simply voting.  We actually need to do the <em>work</em> of democracy – reading upcoming bills, understanding the mechanisms of government, writing to our representatives, learning about the issues facing our city, our province, and our world.</p>
<p>We could also start encoding more information in the ballot.  A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote">Single Transferrable Vote</a> system would go some way towards doing that.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">

                    
        
<p>According to <a href="http://www.threehundredeight.com/p/ontario.html">threehundredeight.com</a>,  Barrie is poised on a knife edge for the upcoming provincial election.  The leading candidate is predicted to get 39.2% of the vote, the next candidate, 39.1%.  In other words, we’re the tightest race in Ontario.  For once, I’m genuinely living in a swing riding.</p>
<p>In 2011 the election was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrie_(provincial_electoral_district)#Election_results">decided here by 2,500 votes</a>.  I suspect this time round it will be much closer.  My vote, and the votes of my fellow residences,  may actually make a significant difference to the local and provincial political scene this year.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550">
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Barrie?src=hash">#Barrie</a> is the tightest race in Ontario.  <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/onpoli?src=hash">#onpoli</a>.  @voteannhoggarth , <a href="https://twitter.com/RodneyJackson">@RodneyJackson</a>  should I swing it your way?</p>
<p>— Trevor Morgan (@trvrm) <a href="https://twitter.com/trvrm/statuses/475753570646519808">June 8, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script></p>
<p>But despite it being such a tight race, so far none of the candidates feel like engaging with me on Twitter.  Maybe I should just vote for the first one who replies to me; on the principal that at least it indicates that they understand <em>something</em> about technology; and as a software architect I might want to be represented by somebody who understands my field?</p>
<p>Or maybe not.  I still feel that it’s important to select candidates based on their qualifications, competence and integrity.  Less so on their promises;  I think of electoral promises and manifestoes as interesting works of fiction.  Candidates love to promise more jobs and  economic growth, but I suspect that government has far less power over these matters than most MPs would be willing to admit.  Politicians are quick to claim responsibility for improved unemployment numbers, or an uptick in GDP; but the same politicians in times of recession will be quick to point out that the poor economic news is due to factors beyond their control: inflation, foreign exchange, trade deficits, climate.</p>
<p>The problem is: economics is an inexact science.  It’s very good at providing a narrative explanation for why things happened in the past; it’s far less good at producing predictive power for the future.   Before becoming he Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Gordon Brown famously <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/recession/3497533/Gordon-Brown-admits-he-was-wrong-to-claim-he-had-ended-boom-and-bust.html">promised</a> to bring an end to the cycle of “boom and bust.”  He then presided over the biggest financial crisis in three generations.</p>
<p>So I’m cautious of politician’s promises to increase jobs or reduce debt.  because their ability to affect these matters is probably less than they think.   But I <em>do</em> care about how they will handle the responsibilities that they have been entrusted with.  And I believe that the best way to predict future performance is to look at past performance.  A wise man once said,<strong><a href="http://biblehub.com/gwt/luke/16.htm"> ” Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with a lot. Whoever is dishonest with very little is dishonest with a lot.” </a></strong></p>
<p>So when you come to make your choice, ask yourself – ‘what has this candidate done in the past?  How well have they acquitted themselves of the responsibilities they’ve been given? ‘</p>
<p>And if you can’t come up with good answers for those questions, vote for somebody else.</p>

<p>None of our local candidates felt like answering my question about our provincial parks.  Canada is blessed with some of the largest and richest wilderness areas in the world; we owe it to the planet and our children to tend and protect them.  I’d like to see the candidates talk about this more.</p>

<p>I can only speculate that this is another example of a political leader still thinking in terms of push-media and message discipline.  I wonder what the meeting looked like when they were planning this move.</p>
<p><em><strong>Spy #1</strong>: “Hey, people don’t seem to like us very much.”</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Spy #2:</strong> “Strange that.  I wonder why?”</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Spy #1:</strong> “Do you think it has anything to do with the way we’ve <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/07/the-terrifying-background-of-the-man-who-ran-a-cia-assassination-unit/259856/">assassinated</a> people, lied repeatedly, performed chemical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra">experiments</a> on unsuspecting victims, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d'%C3%A9tat">overthrown elected governments</a> and  used torture, kidnapping and murder as standard practice?  The way we’ve committed <a href="http://www.wired.com/2012/04/secret-torture-memo/">war crimes</a> with impunity?</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Spy #2:</strong> “Maybe – I suppose it could be because of the way that we managed to get ourselves <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/05/leak-cia-report-torture-redacted-transparency">appointed in charge of censoring</a> the official report that describes the way we repeatedly tortured to death those in our custody?</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Spy #1:</strong> “Doesn’t really sound plausible, does it?”</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Spy #2</strong>: “No.   I bet it’s just because we don’t have a Twitter account.  We should get one of those things.”</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Spy #1</strong>: “Good idea!  And make sure that our first tweet is an attempt at humour – that will show everyone that really we’re just a bunch of fun-loving guys, and not at all cold-blooded killers with no respect for the rule of law.”</em></p>
<hr />
<p>I’m not sure that this is going how they expected.   <a href="https://twitter.com/nybooks/status/475022837733146624">The New York Review of Books is taking the opportunity to regularly ping @CIA with extracts from a damning Red Cross report on the agencies use of torture and secret prisons.</a>  In an ideal world, the CIA would actually take this opportunity to enter into a balanced dialog; maybe explain some of their actions of the past 50 years; and who knows, even come to some comprehension of the horrific impact their human rights violations have had.</p>
<p>I suspect that’s even less likely than a politician responded to my tweets.  But I live in hope.</p>

<p>So far only the Green party (<a href="https://twitter.com/BarrieGreens">@BarrieGreens</a>) has responded to any of my tweets, so I’ve been thinking about the nature of political conversations.</p>
<p>The essence of any conversation is that it goes both ways. Social media gives us the <em>opportunity</em> to have good, serious political conversations with MPs and candidates, but it doesn’t guarantee that we will.  Frankly, I see failings on both sides of the table.</p>
<p>The politicians are failing by still thinking in terms of push media.  Twitter is seen as one more way to promote today’s sound-bite.  For a cohort of political animals who grew up in the era of message-control, the idea of going off-script to engage in genuine dialog must be terrifying.  I got a phone call just now from the Liberal party asking if they had my support; I told them that I was still on the fence, and took the opportunity to ask them their position on affordable housing – a <a href="http://voteforhousing.ca/?page_id=178">critical issue here in Barrie</a>.   The caller had no idea how to answer my question apart from directing me to their website.  Even a ‘thank you, I’ll convey your concern to <a href="https://twitter.com/voteannhoggarth">Ann Hogarth</a>‘ would have been valuable.</p>
<p>But there are failing on the other side of the table too.  We, the voter, owe it to the candidates to actually be informed about their jobs.  If we truly believe in representational government, then that means that politicians <em>work for us.</em>  We, the people, are in charge.  And a good boss is acutely aware of what he expects his employees to do, how well equipped they are to do it, what issues they are struggling with and how best to motivate them.  If we only tune in to politics for a couple of weeks before the election, we can’t really complain if the parties treat us as <a href="http://renaissancenow.ca/2014/06/04/selling-competing-or-serving/" title="Selling, Competing, or Serving?">consumers</a> of a product rather than their employers.</p>
<p>Only an informed citizenry can make wise decisions.  We owe it to ourselves and to each other to understand the basic mechanisms of parliamentary government, the provincial budget, and the upcoming issues.   But more than that, we need to decide <em>what we are trying to achieve.</em>  Companies have mission statements.  Google is trying to ‘<a href="http://www.google.ca/about/company/">organise the world’s information</a>.’   Charity:Water exists to bring <a href="http://www.charitywater.org/about/mission.php">safe water to people in developing nations</a>.</p>
<p>If we are to thrive as individuals, we need to know what <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/The-Power-Story-Destiny-Business/dp/0743294688">story we are telling</a>.  And if we are to thrive as a group of individuals, as a province, we also should know what story we want to tell, what we want to achieve, and what we want our shared future to look like.</p>

<p>The great thing about living in the era of social media is that political conversations no longer need to be one way.  You can reach out to candidates through Twitter and enter into a productive discussion about policies and experience.</p>

<p>Of course, this relies on the candidates actually replying, as opposed to simply treating Twitter as yet another ‘push’ channel.  No one replied to me, so I’ll have to talk about something else.</p>
<p>Specifically, the ways that we misconstrue elections.  I have this strange ideal that elections are an opportunity for the citizenry of the province to have a serious discussion about our common goals, and the ways in which we intend to reach them.  I like the metaphor of a <em>conversation.</em>   However, there are two other metaphors that seem far more prevalent.</p>
<p>Firstly, the metaphor of <em>sports.</em>  Some people support their party with the same fervour that they support their local sports team.  The fact that the Maple Leafs haven’t won the Stanley Cup in nearly half a century doesn’t deter thousands of people from supporting them, cheering for them, and avidly following them.  Real fans are emotionally attached to their team, regardless of their actual performance.   The way we identify with sports team is a strange phenomenon.  <em>None</em> of the Toronto Blue Jays are from Toronto, or even from Ontario.  And in the same way that we root for our sports team to win, we root for our favourite politicians to win.  Predictably, immediately after the debates last night, there were claims that this or that candidate had ‘won’.</p>
<p>The other metaphor that is common is that of <em>sales</em>.</p>

<p>Candidates and parties are advertised and sold.  And that would only make sense if we thought of voters as <em>consumers.  </em> But I am a <em>citizen</em>, not a consumer.  I don’t want to buy something from the candidates.  I want them to represent me and my fellow Ontarians.   As I’ve said before – an election is like a job interview.  I don’t want the candidates commercials, I want their resumé.</p>
<p>Tell me what you’ve done.  Don’t make empty promises about the future.  Show me that you’re <em>already</em> working to improve the lives and the environment of people in this province.   And then maybe I’ll consider voting for you.</p>
<p>Oh, and replying to my tweets would be nice, too.  Let’s actually have a conversation!</p>

<p>Apparently our wise and benevolent party leaders had some kind of a debate this evening.</p>
<p><span id="more-1116"></span><img alt="debate" class="aligncenter wp-image-1117 size-full" height="289" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" src="/images/2014/06/debate.jpg" srcset="/images/2014/06/debate.jpg 400w, /images/2014/06/debate-300x216.jpg 300w" width="400" />I expect that it went something like this.</p>
<p>In keeping with my <a href="http://renaissancenow.ca/2014/06/02/provincial-elections-in-the-age-of-social-media/" title="Provincial Elections in the Age of Social Media">goal</a> of engaging with this election purely through social media, I didn’t watch the televised debate.  Instead, I followed its impact on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ondebate">Twitter</a>.   In doing so, I learned a few things.</p>
<p>Firstly, the parties are waking up to the power of social media.  All three main parties kept up a steady stream of message-reinforcing tweets throughout the debate.</p>
<p>Secondly, elections are not optimistic events.  Around half of all the tweets from the parties and their representatives were attacks on each other.  And nearly <em>all</em> the tweets from everyone else to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ondebate">#ondebate</a> were complaining about the behaviour of the debaters.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>There is officially no alternatives in “big P” politics, not much of a “debate,” just partisan pandering. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23onpoli&amp;src=hash">#onpoli</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ONdebate&amp;src=hash">#ONdebate</a></p>

<p><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script></p>
<p>I didn’t see a single instance of someone tweeting “ah, one of the candidates just made an excellent point and changed my mind on an issue of policy.”</p>
<p>Because it seems that debates aren’t really about bringing Ontarians together to make good plans for the future of the province.   Instead, we treat them more like a team sport.  There are endless attempts to score points, and prevent the opposing team from doing so.  And then afterwards there will be the predictable stream of claims that our preferred candidate ‘won’ the debate.</p>
<p>But I don’t want a candidate to win.  I want <em>Ontarians</em> to win.</p>
<p>I believe that elections are a little like job interviews.  When I’m interviewing a candidate, I want to know two things.  Are they <em>competent</em> enough to do the job, and do they have enough <em>integrity</em> that I’d want to work with them.</p>
<p>I don’t know everything about what it takes to run a province, but if a candidate spent their entire interview badmouthing the other candidates, and then immediately bragged that they had ‘won’ the interview, then I certainly wouldn’t hire them.</p>
<p>The one thing that we do learn from debates is what issues politicians think that we care about.</p>
<p>I care deeply about our environment, about affordable housing, about a strong social system, a fair justice system, and quality healthcare.</p>
<p>I also care that we are represented by leaders who can work effectively with each other, who recognize their own limitations, and who recognize that they are hired to serve the needs of their constituents.</p>
<p>So far, none of the party leaders have given me a good reason to vote for them.  I’ve seen many discussions on Facebook and Twitter in the last couple of days about the best way to register a protest vote – whether to abstain completely from voting, or refuse the ballot, or vote for a third party.   One thing this social media experiment is telling me is that we’re experience a high degree of cynicism with the existing status quo.</p>
<p>It could be worse, I guess. We live in one of the richest, healthiest, safest, fairest societies in the world.  And we <em>do</em> have the opportunity to engage with the political system to a degree unheard of in many parts of the world, and for that I am profoundly grateful.  I hope this weeks political discussion can be about more than expressing dissatisfaction – I hope it can be genuinely productive.</p>

<p>So the Ontario Provincial elections are rapidly approaching.  And with little over a week to go, I realise that I have no idea who I will vote for.</p>
<p>Earlier today I had an interesting and slightly frustrating conversation on facebook with someone who was convinced that the best way to effect political change in the province was to abstain from voting.  To me, this feels like thinly veiled apathy masquerading as action.   Not least, while neglecting to vote, (or <a href="http://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2014/05/20/better_choices_than_none_of_the_above_goar.html">refusing your ballot</a>, a far better option) may indicate your displeasure with the <em>current</em> state of political affairs in the province, it doesn’t broadcast any information at all about your <em>desired</em> state of affairs.</p>
<p><span id="more-1112"></span>Elections are, in part, information gathering exercises.  They are not perfect, as each individual can only register a very small amount of data – a single ti<img alt="Trillium_ovatum_ssp_ovatum_2" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1113" height="268" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="/images/2014/06/Trillium_ovatum_ssp_ovatum_2-300x268.jpg" srcset="/images/2014/06/Trillium_ovatum_ssp_ovatum_2-300x268.jpg 300w, /images/2014/06/Trillium_ovatum_ssp_ovatum_2-1024x915.jpg 1024w, /images/2014/06/Trillium_ovatum_ssp_ovatum_2.jpg 1200w" width="300" />ck in a single box.  And yet they are one of the best mechanisms we have so far for divining the wants and desires of the province or country as a whole.  And I am profoundly grateful to live in a country that believes in free and fair elections, and believes in open, unfettered political discourse.  I was reminded today that this <a href="http://qz.com/215581/chinas-mandatory-tiananmen-amnesia-has-been-incredibly-effective/">isn’t the case everywhere</a>.</p>
<p>So, given that we live in an era of instant communications, I shall spend the next 10 days seeing whether I can gather enough information to make an informed choice.  I will start by following my local and provincial candidates on Twitter, and then I will try reaching out to all of them with some simple questions about policy and experience.</p>
<p>I believe that elections are like job interviews, with the voting public in the employers seat.  A good candidate should demonstrate their suitability for the job, their credentials, their experience, and their character.  I also believe that <i>integrity</i> and <em>competence</em> are far more important than <em>policies.</em>  I have no interest in what a candidate claims that he or she will do if elected if they have not demonstrated both their integrity and their competence.  Without integrity, their promises mean nothing, and without competence, I can have no faith that they will actually be able to carry out their plans.</p>
<p>So how will we judge these two character traits?  I submit that the best predictor of future performance is past performance.  An individual who has shown themselves to be an honest and competent administrator will make a good MPP.  Conversely, an incompetent or dishonest individual should not be allowed anywhere near Queen’s Park.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">

                    
        
<p>In the last couple of days, Russian troops have moved to occupy Simferapol in the Crimean peninsula.  This may be part of a larger effort to deter the Ukraine from continuing to turn towards Europe for patronage, but a quick glance at the map makes at least part of Russia’s motivation very clear.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea_Fleet">Russian Black Sea Fleet</a> is stationed in Sevastopol.  Ever since the breakup of the Soviet Union there has been tension between Russia and the Ukraine over her continued presence, and Russia’s lease was only extended a few years ago.  The fleet has had it’s home there for <em>two hundred and thirty years.</em>  I cannot imagine that Russia would be willing to lose this critical part of her strategic protection.   And if we look at the <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@46.5731668,32.8541483,7z">map</a>, we see that the only main road to Sevastopol passes through Simferopol, the administrative centre of Crimea.  If Simferopol is secured and under Russian control, the Black Fleet is safe.</p>
<p>The British equivalent might be Faslane Naval base, home of her nuclear fleet.  I cannot imagine the UK countenancing any threat to Faslane, although the demands for Scottish independence must surely be giving the Navy’s senior commanders some serious headaches right now.</p>
<p>But back to the Crimea.  Shocking though it is to see Russia so casually violate the sovereignty of a neighbour, I can only hope that her purpose is merely to defend a key military installation, rather than to forcefully shepherd the entire Ukraine back into a closer union with her former overlords.</p>
