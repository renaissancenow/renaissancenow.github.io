<div>As a teenager, I grew up listening to the music of celtic rock band <i><a href="http://www.iona.uk.com/">Iona</a>.</i>  One song in particular has stuck in my head ever since.</div>
<blockquote><p>Here I stand, looking out to sea<br />
Where a thousand souls have prayed<br />
And a thousand lives were laid on the sand<br />
Were laid on the sand</p>
<p>Years have passed, since they have died<br />
And The Word shall last<br />
And the Wild Goose shall fly<br />
Shall fly</p>
<p>Here I stand, looking out to sea<br />
And I say a prayer<br />
That the Wild Goose will come to me<br />
That the Wild Goose will come to me</p></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="465" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tOJmc5ygm9Q?feature=oembed" width="620"></iframe></p>
<p> </p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>Jutting out into the cold, stormy waters of the Northern Atlantic ocean off the coast of Scotland lies the tiny, rocky island of Iona.  To get there even today requires many hours of travel by train and ferry.  It was here, 15 centuries ago, that Saint Columba founded a tiny monastery.  And over the years, that tiny monastery became a center of gravity for the spread of the budding Christian faith.  It had none of the pomp, wealth, or power of Rome, and yet monks from Iona travelled in tiny boats over tumultuous seas to carry the message of the cross throughout Northern Europe.</div>
<div></div>
<div>When I was 19 I met a Christian girl from Finland who proudly told me how the gospel had been brought to her country from Iona more than a thousand years previously.  These early navigators chose to see the treacherous waters of the Atlantic and the North Sea not as insurmountable barriers, but as highways.</div>
<div></div>
<div><img alt="TrevorIona" class=" size-medium wp-image-1340 alignright" height="300" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="/images/2015/05/TrevorIona-200x300.jpg" srcset="/images/2015/05/TrevorIona-200x300.jpg 200w, /images/2015/05/TrevorIona.jpg 500w" width="200" />More than once, Viking raiding parties attacked the island, and on one occasion, as the song lyrics above note, the monastic population of the island was massacred on the beach at Martyrs bay.  A few years ago, I was fortunate enough to make my own pilgrimage to the island, and stand on the same beach that the martyrs died on, and that I heard sung about as a teenager.</div>
<div></div>
<div>It was a profound and holy moment.  But even more powerful, perhaps, is the fact that even today, more than a millennium later, there is still a Christian community on Iona.   The impact of those ancient saints is still being felt across Europe.  And I can still count myself as connected to the same family of faith.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>One fascinating aspect of Celtic christianity is that they chose, it is said, to represent the holy spirit in their art not as a dove, but as a wild goose.  It intrigues me that they chose to symbolize the third member of the Trinity in this way.</div>
<div></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">Wild.</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">Untameable.</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">Haunting.</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">Free.</div>
<div style="text-align: center;"></div>
<div>I know that sometimes we have a desire to tame faith.  To organize it, put boundaries around it, make it safe and predictable. But faith, I have found, is often unpredictable.</div>
<div></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">Chaotic.</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">Disruptive.</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">Wild.</div>
<div style="text-align: center;"></div>
<div>I wonder if those Celtic monks chose to imagine the Holy Spirit as a wild goose as a result of their experiences on navigating the restless northern seas?  A missionary in Antioch, or Rome, or Constantinople, may have decided to walk to another city, and have a fair idea of the journey ahead of him, and the time it would take to arrive.  But a monk pushing a small, oil-soaked leather coracle off from the beach in Iona may have had little idea where the winds would take him; whether he would find safe harbour at the end of his voyage or whether he would be swept up in a terrible storm.  Perhaps he was forced to learn to trust in the unexpected guidance of the Holy Spirit?</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<div> Before he put out into uncharted waters, the renowned navigator Saint Brendan is said to have prayed these words:</div>
<blockquote>
<div>Shall I abandon, O King of mysteries, the soft comforts of home? Shall I turn my back on my native land, and turn my face towards the sea?<br />
Shall I put myself wholly at your mercy, without silver, without a horse, without fame, without honor?<br />
Shall I throw myself wholly upon You, without sword and shield, without food and drink, without a bed to lie on?<br />
Shall I say farewell to my beautiful land, placing myself under Your yoke?<br />
Shall I pour out my heart to You, confessing my manifold sins and begging forgiveness, tears streaming down my cheeks?<br />
Shall I leave the prints of my knees on the sandy beach, a record of my final prayer in my native land?<br />
Shall I then suffer every kind of wound that the sea can inflict?<br />
Shall I take my tiny boat across the wide sparkling ocean?<br />
O King of the Glorious Heaven, shall I go of my own choice upon the sea?</div>
</blockquote>
</div>

<div></div>
<div>I have been blessed, over the years, to encounter communities that have taught me a little bit about this Wild Goose, the Holy Spirit.  As a teenager, I attended a Pentecostal summer camp, where profound, emotional encounters with the Holy Spirit were as commonplace as worship services that lasted until the early hours of the morning.  In my twenties, I was fortunate to be part of the Emerging church movement, as a loose-knit group of people tried to figure out new and creative ways of being Christ followers.  During trips to England, as well as visiting the island of Iona, we also managed to attend <a href="https://www.greenbelt.org.uk/">Greenbelt Festival</a>, a fascinatingly diverse celebration of art, justice, and faith.  And a couple of years ago I heard of a similarly-intentioned festival here in North America, the appropriately named <a href="http://wildgoosefestival.org/festival-2014/about/">Wild Goose Festival</a>.</div>
<div></div>
<div>On their website, they explain their name like this:</div>
<blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>“Wild Goose” is a Celtic spirituality metaphor that evokes unpredictability, beauty, and grace.</div>
</blockquote>
<div>
<blockquote>
<div>We take inspiration from this concept, as well as many events such as <a href="http://www.greenbelt.org.uk/" target="_blank">Greenbelt</a>, <a href="http://www.burningman.com/">Burning Man</a>, <a href="http://www.iona.org.uk/" target="_blank">the Iona Community</a> and <a href="http://sxsw.com/" target="_blank">SXSW</a>.</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>This year I’m going to make a pilgrimage to Hot Springs, North Carolina, to attend this festival for the first time.  And I’m looking forward to meeting passionate, different, disruptive, innovative, diverse people.  And maybe, maybe, I’ll hear the call of the Wild Goose once more.</div>

                <h2><a href="/2013/08/07/different-stories/">Different Stories</a></h2>
                
                
                <div class="entry-content">

                    
        
<p>I realized on my run this morning, in a moment of it’s-probably-obvious-to-everyone-else-but-a-revelation-to-me clarity, just how many <i>different</i> stories there are in the Bible.  I have at the back of my mind this idea that the Christian experience should be more-or-less the same for everyone, but a cursory glance at the Bible with open eyes should really disabuse me of that notion.</p>
<p>Jacob, for example, experienced God as the opponent in a wrestling match.  Moses experienced God as a burning bush, or a pillar of fire.  Job experienced God as a courtroom adversary, (and then both counsel for the defence and judge.)  David experienced God as all-knowing, all-seeing.  Habakkuk experienced God as frustratingly obtuse, Jonah experienced God as frustratingly merciful.</p>
<p>When Jesus turned up on the scene, the Bible continues in this vein.  The Pharisees encountered him as a dangerous challenge. Mary experienced tender compassion.  Peter experienced bold challenge.  Paul experienced dramatic life reversal.  John experienced profound philosophical satisfaction.</p>
<p>Why on earth, then, do I have this story in my head of the Christian experience being one of ‘convert, join a church, meander along in a reasonably satisfactorily middle class life, don’t get into trouble?’</p>
<p>If everyone who encounters God in the Bible had a <i>unique</i> story to tell about the experience, surely the only thing I can expect for sure about my spiritual narrative is that it will, also, be unique?</p>

<p>From the Pope’s address this morning:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>“The Lord has redeemed all of us, all of us, with the Blood of Christ: all of us, not just Catholics</b><b>.</b><b> Everyone! ‘Father, the atheists?’ Even the atheists</b><b>.</b><b> Everyone! And this Blood makes us children of God of the first class! We are created children in the likeness of God and the Blood of Christ has redeemed us all! And we all have a duty to do good. And this commandment for everyone to do good, I think, is a beautiful path towards peace. If we, each doing our own part, if we do good to others, if we meet there, doing good, and we go slowly, gently, little by little, we will make that culture of encounter: we need that so much. We must meet one another doing good. ‘But I don’t believe, Father, I am an atheist!’ But do good: we will meet one another there.”</b></p>

                <h2><a href="/2013/03/31/an-unfortunate-poem/">An Unfortunate Poem</a></h2>
                
                
                <div class="entry-content">

                    
        
<p>I was shown <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNVW5iWqzCQ">this</a> poem earlier today, and disliked it immediately.</p>
<p>In part, because it stands in such stark contrast to the grace-filled message of welcome in the Easter sermon of John Chrysotom that I just <a href="http://renaissancenow.ca/2013/03/31/rich-or-poor-observant-or-negligent-first-or-last-rejoice-today/" title="Rich or poor, observant or negligent, first or last, rejoice today!">posted</a>.<span id="more-863"></span></p>
<p>Chrysotom reassures all that there is a place at the table.  A place for those who are committed in their religious devotions, and a place for those who are negligent.  A place for those who a rich, and those who are poor.  A place for those who are weary of doing good, and a place for those who are weary of failing again and again.</p>
<p><a class="thumbnail" href="/images/2013/03/poem.png"><img alt="poem" class="size-medium wp-image-864 alignright" height="167" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="/images/2013/03/poem-300x167.png" srcset="/images/2013/03/poem-300x167.png 300w, /images/2013/03/poem.png 634w" width="300" /></a>In contrast, ‘Odd Thomas’ begins his poem by attacking those who don’t share his beliefs.  The only reasons someone might not agree with him, he says, is because they are a ‘rationalist, a relativist, a religious, or a reservationist.’</p>
<p>I see this too often.  Christians find it hard to believe that others might have deep reasons for their own religious convictions, and so assume that they must be rejecting Christianity out of stupidity or spite.</p>
<p>But how would it feel to be on the receiving end of this? How would I feel if, say, a member of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism">Jainist</a> faith started threatening me with punishment and death because I didn’t believe the same things that he did?  What if he accused me of being stupid, of being inconsistent, of deliberately choosing to ignore the plain truths revealed in their doctrines?</p>
<p>The frustrating thing about this is that it’s not even hard to find out why some folks reject Christianity in North America.  Thanks to books like ‘<a href="http://www.unchristian.com/">unChristian</a>‘, we know that a majority of young people consider the church to be homophobic, judgemental, hypocritical, overly political and exclusionary.</p>
<p>Poems like this one that accuse sceptics of Christianity of being ignorant and stubborn do not help at all.</p>

for forgiveness has risen from the grave.</p>
<p>Let no one fear death, for the Death of our Savior has set us free.<br />
He has destroyed it by enduring it.<br />
He destroyed Hell when He descended into it.<br />
He put it into an uproar even as it tasted of His flesh.</p>
<p>Isaiah foretold this when he said,<br />
“You, O Hell, have been troubled by encountering Him below.”<br />
Hell was in an uproar because it was done away with.<br />
It was in an uproar because it is mocked.<br />
It was in an uproar, for it is destroyed.<br />
It is in an uproar, for it is annihilated.<br />
It is in an uproar, for it is now made captive.</p>
<p>Hell took a body, and discovered God.<br />
It took earth, and encountered Heaven.<br />
It took what it saw, and was overcome by what it did not see.</p>
<p>O death, where is thy sting?<br />
O Hell, where is thy victory?</p>
<p>Christ is Risen, and you, o death, are annihilated!<br />
Christ is Risen, and the evil ones are cast down!<br />
Christ is Risen, and the angels rejoice!<br />
Christ is Risen, and life is liberated!</p>
<p>Christ is Risen, and the tomb is emptied of its dead;<br />
for Christ having risen from the dead,<br />
is become the first-fruits of those who have fallen asleep.</p>
<p>To Him be Glory and Power forever and ever. Amen!</p>

                <div class="entry-content">

                    
        
<p>Now this is interesting.  A <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/03/05/us/catholics-poll-graphic.html?ref=us">survey</a> at the New York Times shows a significant difference of opinion between the average person in the pew and the Catholic church hierarchy.  66% favour allowing priests to marry.  79% favour the use of birth control, and my understanding is that a higher percentage of Catholics than that will actually use birth control at some point.<span id="more-826"></span></p>
<p>I’d be<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/03/05/us/catholics-poll-graphic.html?ref=us"><img alt="" class="alignright" height="354" src="http://i.imgur.com/CgV6pWx.png" width="385" /></a> very interested in seeing what these figures look like on a global basis, whether this is a uniquely North American phenomenon, or whether there is genuinely a huge rift between the official teaching of the hierarchy and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensus_fidelium"><em>Sensus Fidelium</em></a>, the understanding of the faithful, of the church as a whole.</p>
<p>This raises questions for those outside the Catholic church, too.  What happens when  the official key holders of doctrine state one thing but the general population holds a different position?</p>
<p>From inside the system, it’s easy to say ‘we have the Truth on matters of ethics and behaviour, and those who disagree with us do so because they wish to behave immorally.’</p>
<p>But on matters such as the ordination of women priests, this is seen as an issue of justice and equality.  The laity has considered the position of the hierarchy and said ‘No.  We believe that you are in the wrong here.  The right, honourable and just thing to do is to stop discriminating on grounds of gender.’</p>
<p>What happens when a long-held claim to divine authority encounters a groundswell sense that the hierarchy is actually in the wrong?</p>

<p>Just read through the complete text of the EFC report <em><a href="http://hemorrhagingfaith.com/">Hemorrhaging Faith</a>.  </em></p>

<p>Although it is somewhat skewed by its biases, it’s a valuable document.  A solid research effort went into interviewing several thousand participants and analysing their responses.</p>
<p>All of the participants were between 18 and 34, and all had some kind of church background.  The study examines the extent to which they are currently engaged with the institutional church, and their reasons for their level of engagement.</p>
<p>It’s a welcome document, not least because it is firmly rooted in the Canadian context.  For once, we don’t have to rely on American materials to understand our culture.  The unique religious environment in Quebec is examined, as are the churchgoing trends of first-generation immigrants.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the report doesn’t go far enough.  It recognises the large number of young people who have rejected the church, and carefully notes their reasons, but doesn’t really allow that their criticisms might be valid.  The report sometimes feels as if it has been written by a group that used to enjoy a position of influence and prestige in society, and is frustrated that now it needs to compete on a level playing field with other sources of information and ideas.</p>
<p>Despite that, I’d recommend the report to any church leader, and I’d recommend thinking long and hard about the implications of the report’s findings.</p>

                <h2><a href="/2012/10/19/the-unpleasant-story-of-samson/">The Unpleasant Story of Samson.</a></h2>
                
                
                <div class="entry-content">

                    
        
<p>A Bible study group I attended last night touched on some emotional nerves, as we talked through the <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Judges%2016:23-31&amp;version=NIV" target="_blank" title="Judges 16:23-31">end of Samson’s life</a>.</p>
<p>I think that I react to what I perceive as glibness in the face of human suffering. If we’re talking about the story of Samson, we cannot ignore the fact that it ends with an act of terrorism, with profoundly disturbing similarities to the September 11 terrorist attacks. Here is a guy whose last act is one of religious vengeance: he knocks down two towers, killing himself and 3,000 other people.</p>
<p>I do not believe, I <strong>cannot</strong> believe, that Samson is to be in anyway respected or emulated.</p>
<p>And I guess I do find it worrying when we happily sit around splitting theological hairs about predestination and ignoring the horror of the passage that we are encountering. Maybe it’s because familiarity has dulled the human tragedy of the story? Maybe we say ‘it’s in the Bible, so it must be OK?’ Maybe we think that the point of the story is to give us a nice cozy life application for the week?</p>
<p>Or maybe we realise that if we looked too deeply, we’d have to acknowledge that the author of this story portrays God as being complicit in this massacre? And that’s not something that any of us are comfortable with, least of all me.</p>
<p>Some of our theologians deal with this by saying ‘yes, sure God can kill anyone he wants whenever he wants, and that’s fine.’</p>
<p>The first part of that sentence makes sense – if God is omnipotent, then of course he can.</p>
<p>The second implication in the sentence horrifies me. Because it tends to include the implication that <em>we shouldn’t let this bother us.</em> That to react emotionally to human death and suffering is somehow a sign of a weak faith.</p>
<p>If this is truly the case, then I don’t want that faith. I’d rather hold on to my humanity.</p>
<p>There are parallels with this and the unfortunate responses to grief that we’ve experienced occasionally. Some people think that if we can <em>explain</em> suffering, then we don’t need to console the grieving. That what the person suffering bereavement most needs is a helpful book explaining how their loss is all part of some bigger picture that they are unable to see.</p>
<p>This is, of course, callous in the extreme. A mourner doesn’t need an explanation. They need compassion. And they need someone to share their burden, not someone to tell them that it doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>Likewise on a larger scale. Faced with the horrors of genocide, of war, of sickness, of death, I don’t actually need or want someone to come along and say ‘yes, well, this is all perfectly OK because it fits neatly into my theological schema.’ I want someone to acknowledge the horror of what we are witnessing. I want a mourner, not a theologian.</p>
<p>I guess this is an easy trap to fall into. Preachers are taught that their job is to <em>explain</em> the passage. <em>Here is a story of a man called Samson. Here is what happened in his life. Here is the background. Here is what other theologians have said about it. Here is what we can learn from the passage. Now we can go and have coffee.</em></p>
<p>But maybe that’s not the point? Maybe that’s not needed from the preacher? Maybe that’s not even the point of the story?</p>
<p>The art that we remember that comes out of atrocities is not abstract, clinical and structured. We remember <em><a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/175898">Dulce et Decorum Est</a></em> not because it gives a high level view of the political causes of the First World War or military strategy, but because it viscerally reveals to us the real experience of one individual caught up in the terror of a gas attack.</p>
<p>At that point the author, Wilfred Owen,  is not telling us about the grand meaning of the conflict. He is telling us what it is like to see his companion fail to get his gas mask on before the poison chokes his lungs.</p>
<p>We rush to explanation too fast. We want to say that we have mastered the passage.  What would happen if we were willing to say <em>“huh. This is tough. This represents an ugly side of humanity. And maybe it even represents an ugly side of humanity’s concept of God.”</em></p>
