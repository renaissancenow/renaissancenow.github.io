<p>Are there any who are devout lovers of God?<br />
Let them enjoy this beautiful bright festival!</p>
<p>Are there any who are grateful servants?<br />
Let them rejoice and enter into the joy of their Lord!</p>
<p>Are there any weary with fasting?<br />
Let them now receive their wages!</p>
<p><span id="more-860"></span></p>
<p>If any have toiled from the first hour,<br />
let them receive their due reward;<br />
If any have come after the third hour,<br />
let him with gratitude join in the Feast!<br />
And he that arrived after the sixth hour,<br />
let him not doubt; for he too shall sustain no loss.<br />
And if any delayed until the ninth hour,<br />
let him not hesitate; but let him come too.<br />
And he who arrived only at the eleventh hour,<br />
let him not be afraid by reason of his delay.<br />
For the Lord is gracious and receives the last even as the first.<br />
He gives rest to him that comes at the eleventh hour,<br />
as well as to him that toiled from the first.</p>
<p>To this one He gives, and upon another He bestows.<br />
He accepts the works as He greets the endeavor.<br />
The deed He honors and the intention He commends.<br />
Let us all enter into the joy of the Lord!</p>
<p>First and last alike receive your reward;<br />
rich and poor, rejoice together!<br />
Sober and slothful, celebrate the day!<br />
You that have kept the fast, and you that have not,<br />
rejoice today for the Table is richly laden!</p>
<p>Feast royally on it, the calf is a fatted one.<br />
Let no one go away hungry. Partake, all, of the cup of faith.<br />
Enjoy all the riches of His goodness!</p>
<p>Let no one grieve at his poverty,<br />
for the universal kingdom has been revealed.</p>
<p>Let no one mourn that he has fallen again and again;<br />
for forgiveness has risen from the grave.</p>
<p>Let no one fear death, for the Death of our Savior has set us free.<br />
He has destroyed it by enduring it.<br />
He destroyed Hell when He descended into it.<br />
He put it into an uproar even as it tasted of His flesh.</p>
<p>Isaiah foretold this when he said,<br />
“You, O Hell, have been troubled by encountering Him below.”<br />
Hell was in an uproar because it was done away with.<br />
It was in an uproar because it is mocked.<br />
It was in an uproar, for it is destroyed.<br />
It is in an uproar, for it is annihilated.<br />
It is in an uproar, for it is now made captive.</p>
<p>Hell took a body, and discovered God.<br />
It took earth, and encountered Heaven.<br />
It took what it saw, and was overcome by what it did not see.</p>
<p>O death, where is thy sting?<br />
O Hell, where is thy victory?</p>
<p>Christ is Risen, and you, o death, are annihilated!<br />
Christ is Risen, and the evil ones are cast down!<br />
Christ is Risen, and the angels rejoice!<br />
Christ is Risen, and life is liberated!</p>
<p>Christ is Risen, and the tomb is emptied of its dead;<br />
for Christ having risen from the dead,<br />
is become the first-fruits of those who have fallen asleep.</p>
<p>To Him be Glory and Power forever and ever. Amen!</p>
