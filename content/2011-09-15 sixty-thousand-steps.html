So, now would be a good time to regroup and think carefully about setting appropriate goals for myself, taking into account my fitness levels, my time, my propensity towards knee pains and so on.</p>
<p>I’ve done that, and I’ve come up with a new goal for next year.</p>
<p>I’m going to run an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultramarathon">ultramarathon</a>.</p>
<p>Specifically, I want to target a 50k race next year.  Now, this might sound a little crazy given that I’ve never gone beyond 21k, but there actually is method to my madness.  I figure that I’m at a point in my training where I can go one of two ways.  I can carry on running, take time off every time legs complain, and maybe do the odd 5k or 10k race.</p>
<p>Or I set myself what they call in the business world a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Hairy_Audacious_Goal">Big Hairy Audacious Goal</a>.</p>
<p>The thing is, at the moment I can’t possibly run that kind of distance, for some very specific reasons.  My gait isn’t right, and I have very tight hip and thigh muscles, specifically my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliotibial_band_syndrome">ITB</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_fasciae_latae_muscle">TFL</a>.   These aren’t big problems when I’m only running 5k, but are serious limiters when I go out long.  If I stick to shorter runs, then I’ll never have to address these underlying limiters, and I could probably even train out to half marathon reasonably well.</p>
<p>But if I want to go <em>really</em> long, then I can’t fake it.  I have to rebuild my gait properly, and I have to put in the hard work with stretching and foam rollers to work out my problem muscles.  Indeed, I expect I’ll probably spend more time doing this kind of rehab over the winter than actually running.</p>
<p>So, if you live in the neighborhood and see a crazy guy running <a href="http://www.chrismcdougall.com/barefoot.html">barefoot</a> on gravel trails, it’s me re-teaching my ankles and calves to run lightly and fluidly.  And my long-suffering family will have to put up with me grunting through hours of foam roller work.</p>
<p>But I’m going to make this work.  I’m fed up with having my legs give up when I still have fuel in the tank.</p>
<p>And if anyone is looking for a training partner willing to put in some serious mileage, give me a shout.</p>
