<p>Some people have asked me why I’m bothering to undertake this church crawl.  The further I go into this journey, the more I realize that reconciliation, especially between Christian churches, is absolutely essential.</p>
<p>Because if we don’t reconcile, the result will look like this:</p>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/LhDMCRlFAxs?feature=oembed" width="620"></iframe></p>
<p>Watch that video.   When Christ was born, the angels proclaimed <em>“peace on earth”. </em>But today, at the birthplace of Christ, those who are supposed to be his representatives are hitting each other with brooms because they can’t agree on <em>who should sweep a patch of floor.</em>  Seriously.</p>
<p>If we can’t resolve an issue of housekeeping in one of Christianity’s most sacred sites, how will we present ourselves as agents of reconciliation in a broken world?  If we are still divided by arguments that date back a thousand years or more, how can we claim to be being transformed into the image of Christ?</p>
<p>Reconciliation is not something that can be ‘put off’ until later while the we get on with the mission of the church.  Reconciliation <em>is</em> the mission of the church.</p>
