<p>UFC Champion Georges St. Pierre spends a surprising amount of his book <em>The Way of the Fight</em> talking about feet.</p>

<p><em>My feet are the most powerful, important parts of my body.  We’re too busy wearing shoes we think are comfortable – shoes we believe “support” our weight- to even think about the meaning of our feet.</em></p>
<p><em>Shoes kill the sensations in our feet, which affects stability.  You start compensating for your lack of balance with your knees, hips and other parts of your body.</em></p>
<p><em>Feet are the genesis of all movements, especially in mixed martial arts.  It’s where most of our power comes from.</em></p>
<p><em>There are 7,200 nerve endings in each of your feet.  Yet every time you wear shoes or sandals, you’re breaking your connection to the ground.</em></p>
<p><em>Some people will say “Georges, it hurts when I run and my heels hit the ground!”  That’s because your heels aren’t even supposed to hit the ground when you run – even if you’re wearing a shoe.  The whole idea of a heel strike is a mistake.  It’s counterproductive.</em></p>
<p><em>In my stance, my heel almost never touches the ground.  For me, this brings my weight onto the balls of my feet, and that’s where I have an advantage over most of my opponents: I’m always ready to explode or change directions.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I wasn’t expecting to get minimilist running philosophy from a book on mixed martial arts, but I’ve rarely heard it put better.</p>
