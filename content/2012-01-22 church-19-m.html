<p>Yes, today we visited a church who’s name is a single letter.  Because that’s pretty hard to search for in Google, here is their <a href="http://startswithm.org/" title="Starts With M">website</a>!.</p>
<p>‘M’ was quite a contrast from <a href="http://renaissancenow.ca/2012/01/20/church-18-st-marys-catholic-church/" title="Church 18 – St. Mary’s Catholic Church">last week’s</a> Catholic service.  Instead of large, structured and formal, this morning’s service had an almost improvised feel.  ‘M’ is a new community, and so I suspect that at the moment there is no such thing as a typical gathering.    This morning was billed as ‘Bring It’ Sunday, a chance for all members to share a song, a thought, a poem, a reading, or a painting.</p>
<p><a href="/images/2012/01/IMG_00000074.jpg"><img alt="" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-416" height="168" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="/images/2012/01/IMG_00000074-300x168.jpg" srcset="/images/2012/01/IMG_00000074-300x168.jpg 300w, /images/2012/01/IMG_00000074-1024x575.jpg 1024w" title="IMG_00000074" width="300"/></a>Personally, I love this kind of interactive environment.  ‘M’ meets at the <a href="http://thecreativespace.ca/">Creative Space</a> in downtown Barrie, which is an ideal venue for getting a bunch of folks together in a circle to drink coffee, share ideas, listen, talk, and learn.</p>
<p>In some ways, this feels very contemporary, but the idea of group-led worship is nothing new.  The Brethren movement has been doing this kind of thing for more than a century.  Following Paul’s suggestions in <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2014:26&amp;version=NIV">1 Corinthians 14:26</a>, a typical Brethren service, although centered around communion, sets aside a generous chunk of time for anyone present to share with the group a thought, a prayer or a song.</p>
<p>The difference between this kind of church service and a more formally structured one is, perhaps, like the difference between going to a classical concert and taking part in a drumming circle.  The former may be more polished, more predictable, and perhaps ‘safer’.  The latter may be more chaotic, but is definitely more participatory.  Everyone plays a part, and when done well, everyone listens to and responds to each person’s contribution.</p>
<p>‘M’ is still figuring out what it wants to be, I think.  But, if you’re the kind of person who prefers dialog to lecture, or improvisation to formality, then I’d recommend that you pay them a visit.</p>
