<p>For the past year or so I’ve been engaged in what I like to call a <em>Church Crawl,</em> whereby I visit different churches to get a feel for the varied and diverse expressions of Christianity in the city.</p>
<p>In his excellent book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Toward-True-Kinship-Faiths-Religions/dp/0385525052">Towards a True Kinship of Faiths</a>, </em>the Dalai Lama goes several steps further, and provides a sympathetic and extremely well observed review of the teachings and practices of the major world religions, along with a well reasoned consideration of the challenges facing us as a global society as we figure out how to live side by side with people of different cultures and faiths.</p>
<p>One of his most interesting points is the way that he has seen first hand as a citizen of India the ways in which it is possible for those of different religions to live next door to each other peacefully.  He also fearlessly approaches the very real philosophical differences between the monotheistic, polytheistic and non-theistic traditions.</p>
<p>He makes no bones about his commitment to Buddhism, and yet his treatment of Christian theology is one of the most succinct and accurate that I have ever read.</p>
<p>Strongly recommended.</p>
