<p>Apparently, you can be the CEO of a major Canadian company, even if you don’t understand the first thing about free markets.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Godfrey">Paul Godfrey</a> is the President and CEO of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmedia_Network">Postmedia Network</a>, the owners of the National Post.  He’s also the chair of the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation, and previously has been both a politician and the CEO of the Blue Jays.</p>
<p>Despite that impressive resume, he demonstrated during his <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/ontariotoday/2012/09/06/thursday-willing-to-pay-for-your-news-on-line/">interview today</a> on ‘Ontario Today’ a quite startling lack of understanding of the way that free market capitalism works.  He was asked whether, as the National Post and other newspapers try to move to a more restrictive online model, whether readers who are used to free content would be willing to now start paying for it.</p>
<p>In one of the most impressive displays of wishful thinking that I’ve seen in a long time, Mr. Godfrey replied that they <em>would</em>, because they <em>should.</em> He didn’t base this argument on an analysis of market forces, but rather an appeal to to necessity.</p>
<p>Namely, that newspapers would not turn a profit unless people pay them more.</p>
<p>Clearly Mr. Godfrey did not pay attention as Blockbuster saw its business model destroyed by online movies.  Nor did he notice that the classified ads sector lost <em>billions</em> of dollars from its market value when Craigslist appeared.</p>
<p>Tell me.  When you want to buy or sell something, do you post it on Craigslist or Kijiji?</p>
<p>Or do you say to yourself “<em>No no, the poor starving newspaper industry deserves my hard earned cash.  I will pay to post this item in tiny, unsearchable print in the back-end of my local newspaper.  I’m sure it will get noticed sitting in the bottom of a recycling bin.”</em></p>
<p>Paul Godfrey said that “newspapers are going to <em>have</em> to return a profit to their shareholders.”  He said that “the consumers <em>must</em> pay.”  He said that “the public <em>has</em> to remember that the greatest provider of content is newspapers.”</p>
<p>He even said that if you want <em>opinions</em>, you will have to pay newspaper sites.  Who knew that opinions were in such short supply?</p>
<p>The National Post costs money to produce; therefore, in Mr. Godfrey’s fantasy land, loyal citizens of this country will take it upon themselves to re-imburse his expenses.</p>
<p>Except, of course, we won’t.  We’re children of the digital age.  We will continue to learn about our world from<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/"> The Guardian</a>, from <a href="http://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a>, from <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>, from <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/">AlJazeera</a>, from <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/">BBC</a>, from <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/">CBC</a>, from <a href="https://news.google.com">Google News</a>, from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia</a> and <a href="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikinews</a> and from countless other online sources.</p>
<p>And if we’re smart, we’ll divest ourselves of any equity we own in companies run by Mr. Godfrey.  Anyone who thinks that they have a moral <em>right</em> to paying customers should not be a CEO.</p>
