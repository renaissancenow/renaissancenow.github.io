<p>Another day, another missed opportunity.</p>

<p>Today's <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/onpoli?src=hash">#onpoli</a> question: how will you protect &amp; improve our provincial parks? <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidBarrieNDP">@DavidBarrieNDP</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/BarrieGreens">@BarrieGreens</a> @voteannhoggarth <a href="https://twitter.com/RodneyJackson">@RodneyJackson</a></p>

<p>None of our local candidates felt like answering my question about our provincial parks.  Canada is blessed with some of the largest and richest wilderness areas in the world; we owe it to the planet and our children to tend and protect them.  I’d like to see the candidates talk about this more.</p>
<p>In other social media news, the CIA joined Twitter</p>

<p>I can only speculate that this is another example of a political leader still thinking in terms of push-media and message discipline.  I wonder what the meeting looked like when they were planning this move.</p>
<p><em><strong>Spy #1</strong>: “Hey, people don’t seem to like us very much.”</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Spy #2:</strong> “Strange that.  I wonder why?”</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Spy #1:</strong> “Do you think it has anything to do with the way we’ve <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/07/the-terrifying-background-of-the-man-who-ran-a-cia-assassination-unit/259856/">assassinated</a> people, lied repeatedly, performed chemical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra">experiments</a> on unsuspecting victims, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d'%C3%A9tat">overthrown elected governments</a> and  used torture, kidnapping and murder as standard practice?  The way we’ve committed <a href="http://www.wired.com/2012/04/secret-torture-memo/">war crimes</a> with impunity?</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Spy #2:</strong> “Maybe – I suppose it could be because of the way that we managed to get ourselves <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/05/leak-cia-report-torture-redacted-transparency">appointed in charge of censoring</a> the official report that describes the way we repeatedly tortured to death those in our custody?</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Spy #1:</strong> “Doesn’t really sound plausible, does it?”</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Spy #2</strong>: “No.   I bet it’s just because we don’t have a Twitter account.  We should get one of those things.”</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Spy #1</strong>: “Good idea!  And make sure that our first tweet is an attempt at humour – that will show everyone that really we’re just a bunch of fun-loving guys, and not at all cold-blooded killers with no respect for the rule of law.”</em></p>
<hr/>
<p>I’m not sure that this is going how they expected.   <a href="https://twitter.com/nybooks/status/475022837733146624">The New York Review of Books is taking the opportunity to regularly ping @CIA with extracts from a damning Red Cross report on the agencies use of torture and secret prisons.</a>  In an ideal world, the CIA would actually take this opportunity to enter into a balanced dialog; maybe explain some of their actions of the past 50 years; and who knows, even come to some comprehension of the horrific impact their human rights violations have had.</p>
<p>I suspect that’s even less likely than a politician responded to my tweets.  But I live in hope.</p>
