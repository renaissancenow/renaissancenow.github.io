<p>We can learn a lot about a movement from its architecture.  This build is light, airy, and every sight line draws the eye to the central dais, on which a table holds a book and a large offering plate.</p>
<p>The Lutheran liturgy feels both familiar and different to me.  In terms of its basic structure it is virtually identical to an Anglican or Catholic liturgy: we have prayers of confession, Old and New Testament readings, a Gospel reading, the Creed, intercessions, the Lord’s prayer and a sermon, although in most cases the actual phraseology and cadences are quite different to what I’m used too.</p>
<p>As ever, I used the after-church coffee time to ask my questions.</p>
<p><em>Why are you here?</em></p>
<p><em> What is God doing in the city? </em></p>
<p>Apparently, these are not easy questions to answer.  One person told me that this church exists to share the ‘word of God.’  The pastor explained that it exists to teach a ‘theology of the cross, not a theology of glory.’  Another congregant suggested that it exists partly to serve the local community through it’s very well equipped and well regarded day-care facilities.</p>
<p>Some answers were couched in complex theological language.  But I think the most significant answer I heard was from the lady who served me my coffee.</p>
<p><em>“I’m here because this was the first place I that I ever heard that Jesus loves me.”</em></p>
<p>A church could do much worse.</p>
