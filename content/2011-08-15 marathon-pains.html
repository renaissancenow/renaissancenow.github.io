<p>In theory, running should be the most undramatic of sports.  The requirements are simple; you turn up at the start line, and when the horn sounds you run the allotted distance to the finish, at whatever pace you are capable of maintaining.</p>
<p>However yesterday’s inaugural <a href="http://www.barriehalfmarathon.com/">Barrie Half Marathon</a> drove home the point to me that even a simple half-marathon can be a dramatic event. <a href="/images/2011/08/running_feet.jpg"><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-116" height="199" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="/images/2011/08/running_feet-300x199.jpg" srcset="/images/2011/08/running_feet-300x199.jpg 300w, /images/2011/08/running_feet-450x300.jpg 450w, /images/2011/08/running_feet.jpg 500w" title="running_feet" width="300"/></a></p>
<p>It started well, with the course taking us around Kempenfelt Bay on trails that I train on regularly.  This was home ground, and kept my breathing steady and my body loose.</p>
<p>The course brought us back past the start/finish line about half-way through the race.  I crossed the 10k marker enjoying the cheering crowds, running well and on pace to finish close to my personal best time.</p>
<p>A few minutes later I passed the 11k marker limping on knees that had suddenly refused to work.  My quads had tightened up and I my legs would only allow me to run a hundred metres or so before requiring me to stop, stretch, and walk.</p>
<p>So, I walked, limped and hobbled the next ten kilometers. This was a humbling experience for me – I’m used to experiencing races if not from the front, then at least from well up into the ‘business end’.  This time, first I watched the guys I’d been pacing out with vanish into the distance, and then most of the rest of the pack run past me.  At about 17k I was dropped by a guy with only one leg.</p>
<p>Now, this being running, <em>everyone</em> was supportive.  Practically every runner and volunteer called out encouragement or checked if I was OK.  And so, despite running probably the slowest race of my life, and crossing the line at two hours and five minutes, I finished.</p>
<p>And it was worth it.</p>
