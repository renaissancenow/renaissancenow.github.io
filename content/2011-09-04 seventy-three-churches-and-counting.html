<p><a href="/images/2011/09/churchsign1.jpg"><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-150" height="270" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="/images/2011/09/churchsign1-300x270.jpg" srcset="/images/2011/09/churchsign1-300x270.jpg 300w, /images/2011/09/churchsign1-333x300.jpg 333w, /images/2011/09/churchsign1.jpg 400w" title="churchsign" width="300"/></a>The city of Barrie has, as far as I can tell, 73 churches.</p>
<p>This year I intend to visit them all.</p>
<p>Now, you might ask yourself why I would voluntarily choose to sit through 73 sermons, when I could be catching up on sleep, or sitting in Second Cup, or organizing my filing cabinet.</p>
<p>As someone who’s avoided church as much as he could for the last year, and finds it almost impossible to sit through a sermon without either walking out or writing copious notes on each point that I disagree with, I’m even a little surprised myself that I’d choose to do this, but I do have some specific reasons.</p>
<p>I may be a harsh critic of the church, but deep down I do still believe that Christ loves her.  We followers of Christ may be fragmented, we may be argumentative, we may frequently get things wrong, but I believe that Christ sees beyond our denominational boundaries, our weaknesses and our failings, and cares for us and wants to work redemptively through us.</p>
<p>I also have some specific questions that I want to ask to the entire Christian community in Barrie:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>May I come in?</em>  What is really meant by that ‘All Welcome’ sign hanging outside?<br/>
<em></em></li>
<li><em>What is God doing in the city?</em>  I am curious to see whether I will get one answer to this question, or 73.  Will the Ukrainian Orthodox give me the same answer as the Pentecostals?</li>
<li><em>Why is your church here?</em>  Again, I’m intrigued to see how broad a response I will get.  Will the pastor tell me the same thing as the guy sitting next to me in the pew?</li>
</ol>
<p>I suspect other questions will arise as I begin my visits – what would you ask the churches of your city if you had the chance?</p>
