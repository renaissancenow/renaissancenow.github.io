<p>I’m tired.</p>
<p>I ran more than 50 kilometres this week.  As avid readers of this blog (all 3 of them) will know, I’m training for an ultramarathon.  Specifically my goal is to be able to run 50k in a single race.</p>
<p>Given how exhausted I am after having done that distance spread over 6 days, I clearly have a long way to go.</p>
<p>With the help of the <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Triathletes-Training-Bible-Joe-Friel/dp/1931382425">Triathlete’s Training Bible</a>, I’ve written myself a training plan based around a series of four-week cycles of increasing mileage.  Next week I get to take it a bit easier, and then the kilometers will start building up again. <a href="/images/2011/11/weekly_progress.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-314" height="176" sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px" src="/images/2011/11/weekly_progress-1024x310.png" srcset="/images/2011/11/weekly_progress-1024x310.png 1024w, /images/2011/11/weekly_progress-300x91.png 300w, /images/2011/11/weekly_progress-500x151.png 500w, /images/2011/11/weekly_progress.png 1229w" title="weekly_progress" width="584"/></a>Despite my fatigue I’ve been pleased at the way my body has been responding.  On Monday I ran 29 km, the furthest I’ve ever done in one go, and although I was tired at the end my hips and knees didn’t complain at all.  Clearly the work I’ve been doing re-engineering my running style has been paying off. Apparently my body responds well to a high cadence, and to running in sandals or barefoot.</p>
<p>There are different theories as to whether you should incorporate any speedwork while doing base-training.  I’ve chosen to do one fast 5k tempo run every week, so as not to lose my speed completely, and that seems to be working fairly well.  On Thursday I did my 5k only a few seconds per kilometre off of race-pace.</p>
<p>I’m getting a renewed respect for the serious athletes who do several times this mileage week-in, week out.</p>
