<p>I’ve been enjoying <a href="http://vimeo.com/54682881">this documentary series</a> on the <a href="http://www.parisancaster.com/">Paris-Ancaster bike race</a>.  As well as serving as inspiration for me since I signed up for the race, it’s a nice example of SLR film-making, something that’s really becoming more accessible these days.</p>
<p>So, go watch the video and then sign up for the race – there are still a few spots left.</p>
