<p>I’ve tried to drag this site kicking and screaming into, well, whatever we’re calling this current decade.    The goal is a clean, minimalist interface, easy to find articles, and a good user experience on any device.</p>
<p>I’ve also just learned far more about the innards of WordPress than I ever wanted to.  Apparently, if you create a child theme, then you override existing PHP pages by creating new pages with the same name in your child theme folder.  <i>Unless,</i> of course the php page is functions.php.  In that case, both copies get included, causing all sorts of fun and conflicts.</p>
<p>In the end I gave up and edited the parent theme as well, so if I ever update the parent theme I’ll have to make a couple of changes.</p>
<p>Thank goodness for the Chrome WebInspector.  I can’t imagine how we used to do web development before we had tools like that.</p>
