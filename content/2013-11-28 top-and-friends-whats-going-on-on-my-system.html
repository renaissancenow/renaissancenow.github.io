<p>Linux gives you all sorts of ways of keeping an eye on what’s going on your server.  Here are several that I find useful.  Read my post on <a href="http://renaissancenow.ca/2013/11/28/apt-get-making-your-ubuntu-machine-more-better/" title="apt-get: Making your ubuntu machine more better">apt-get</a> to get any of these that may not be installed on your computer.</p>
<p>The grand-daddy of them all is <b>top</b><br/>
<span id="more-1036"></span><br/>
This is like Task Manager on Windows or Activity Monitor on Mac.  It gives you a quick list of all the processes that are running on your computer, how much RAM and processor power they’re using, and how long they’ve been running for.</p>
<p><strong>top</strong>, however has a pretty ugly output format, so it’s good that there are several better alternatives.</p>
<p>My preferred tool is <code>htop</code>, which gives a better visual display, including a nice bar-chart showing CPU usage on all your cores, and the ability to sort by CPU, memory usage etc.</p>
<pre><code>
  CPU[||                                                                          1.3%]     Tasks: 44, 46 thr; 1 running
  Mem[|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||  332/987MB]     Load average: 0.00 0.01 0.05 
  Swp[|                                                                       0/1021MB]     Uptime: 1 day, 13:00:40

  PID USER      PRI  NI  VIRT   RES   SHR S CPU% MEM%   TIME+  Command
24133 trevor     20   0 26420  2756  1456 R  0.7  0.3  0:00.57 htop
 1030 root       20   0 91728  4412  3572 S  0.0  0.4  2:21.86 /usr/sbin/vmtoolsd
 1051 postgres   20   0  129M  5056  3628 S  0.0  0.5  0:24.74 postgres: writer process

</code></pre>
<h3>So what’s making my disk thrash?</h3>
<p><b>htop</b> tells us what processes are using memory and processing power. To see what’s using I/O, use <code>iotop</code>. This needs to be run as root:</p>
<pre><code>
$ sudo apt-get install iotop
$ sudo iotop
</code></pre>
<p>which gives you a list of which processes are reading and writing to disk.</p>
<h3>But what’s using my network connection?</h3>
<p>Likewise, we can monitor network usage using <code>iftop</code></p>
<pre><code>
$ sudo apt-get install iftop
$ sudo iftop</code></pre>
<p>which shows the open connections on your machine and how much data is being passed through them.</p>
<p>An alternative to <code>iftop</code> is <code>nethogs</code> which shows you which processes are responsible for data being passed over your network connections.</p>
<p>I also find <code>netstat</code> useful in these situations. <code>netstat</code> can do a lot, but one way I find myself using it a lot is</p>
<pre><code> $ netstat -plnt </code></pre>
<p>which means ‘show me all the processes on this machine that are listening for TCP/IP connections, and which port they are listening on’. This is very helpful when you’re setting up a machine and you want to verify that, say, your webserver or database server is running correctly.</p>
<p>Linux gives you many, many ways to see what’s going on on your system, and we’ve only scratched the surface her. Check out the rest of my technology toolkit posts:</p>
