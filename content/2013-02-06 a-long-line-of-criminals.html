<p>I have been thinking a lot recently about incarceration.</p>
<p>At its highest levels, the Soviet Union’s <em>gulag</em> system imprisoned 800 people for every 100,000 people in the country.  Today the United States has 743 prisoners for every 100,000 people.  Nearly a quarter of all the prisoners in the world are in United States prisons.</p>
<p>This worries me, and when I read about the Stephen Harper proposing more ‘tough-on-crime’ legislation, I wonder what exactly we are trying to achieve.  But before I delve to deeply into the subject, I first have to recognize how this must be approached.  As a Christian, I belong to a faith tradition that has, frankly, spent quite a lot of time in jail.</p>
<ul>
<li>Joseph was imprisoned for years on <a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/genesis/39.htm">trumped up sexual harassment charges</a>.</li>
<li>David spent his formative years as an outlaw.</li>
<li>Jesus was arrested,  imprisoned, and condemned as a threat to the state.</li>
<li>Paul wrote large chunks of the New Testament from a prison cell.</li>
<li>William Tyndale was imprisoned and executed by the imperial authorities</li>
<li>Martin Luther King wrote his <a href="http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html">most important work</a> from a Birmingham jail.</li>
</ul>
<p>I recognise in our society the need for a judicial system, for police officers, magistrates, prison guards and probation workers.</p>
<p>But when we are discussing the criminal justice system, the starting point for those who call themselves Christians needs to be this – our first and primary identity is with the jailed, not the jailer.  As the founder of our movement said, “<em>I was in prison and you came to visit me.”</em></p>
