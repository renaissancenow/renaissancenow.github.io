<p>Politicians do not spend a lot of time thinking about the issues they vote on, as I <a href="http://renaissancenow.ca/2013/03/25/my-faith-in-democracy-is-being-challenged/" title="My faith in democracy is being challenged">noted yesterday</a>.</p>
<p>I just wrote a little <a href="http://renaissancenow.ca/voting/index.php?voteid=631">tool</a> to demonstrate this.  Have a look at this visual representation of recent votes in the House of Commons?</p>
<p><a href="http://renaissancenow.ca/voting/index.php?voteid=631">Vote Visualisation</a>.</p>
<p>And then ask yourself this – are our representatives carefully considering all the facts before them, and then voting on each issue in a manner that best represents their constituents?</p>
<p>Or are they mindlessly following party orders?<a href="/images/2013/03/votes.png"><img alt="votes" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-843" height="89" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="/images/2013/03/votes-300x89.png" srcset="/images/2013/03/votes-300x89.png 300w, /images/2013/03/votes.png 967w" width="300"/></a></p>
