<p>I guess this posts is part of my ‘church crawl’ series as well as my ‘unanswered questions’ one.  It’ll be short, because the question doesn’t really need to be fleshed out.  It’s very simple.</p>
<p><em>What is the mission of the church?</em></p>
<p>Maybe you can help me answer this.  Some other ways of looking at this question might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why does your church exist?</li>
<li>What is it trying to achieve?</li>
<li>How do you measure ‘success’?</li>
<li>How does your church choose what activities to prioritise?</li>
<li>What are common goals that your church is working towards with other churches in your city?</li>
<li>What are common goals that your denomination is working towards with others?</li>
<li>If someone was wondering whether they should be part of a church at all, what would you say to them?  Do you think it’s important?  Why?</li>
<li>Is the church making progress in her mission?  What impediments exist? What tools are helping?</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe this is a question I should be asking as I visit churches in Barrie.  For now, I’d love to hear people’s opinions and suggestions.  Is there a common mission that applies to all the churches in the city?  What are your thoughts?</p>
