<p>Seven years ago I embarked on my first sabbatical.  I quit my job, moved to England, and spent the year resting, travelling and doing odd contract jobs.</p>
<p>A few hours ago I started my second one.</p>
<p>This video probably explains better than I could the benefits and power of intentionally taking so long away from work.<br/>

Unlike Stefan Sagmeister, I’m probably not going to be spending months in Bali, although I do intend to spend time alone in the wilderness.  I’m also hoping that this will be a time for me to finally get to grips with various creative projects I’ve had in mind for a while.  More than anything it’s going to be a chance to break free from the standard patterns of work, let my brain rest and let my body, soul and spirit be rejuvenated.</p>

<p><em> ‘When you enter the land I am going to give you, the land itself must observe a sabbath to the Lord. For six years sow your fields, and for six years prune your vineyards and gather their crops. But in the seventh year the land is to have a year of sabbath rest, a sabbath to the Lord.</em></p>
