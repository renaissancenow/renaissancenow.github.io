<p>So my facebook feed this morning had a couple of folks worried about ‘the last days’ and ‘the decay of western society’</p>
<p>The cause?  A breathless report worrying that soldiers in the US military may be court martialed for sharing their Christian faith.</p>
<p>At this point I did a daring, radical thing.  I actually looked up the policy in question.  It took me all of about 30 seconds to find it: it’s freely available at <a href="http://www.180fw.ang.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-120820-005.pdf">http://www.180fw.ang.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-120820-005.pdf</a>.  Despite being reported in some circles as being ‘unreal’ or ‘a slap in the face to the military,’ it’s actually a completely unsurprising piece of HR policy that would not be out of place in any large government agency or private enterprise.  The articles in question are as follows:</p>
<p><em><strong>2.11. Government Neutrality Regarding Religion.</strong> Leaders at all levels must balance </em><br/>
<em>constitutional protections for an individual’s free exercise of religion or other personal beliefs </em><br/>
<em>and the constitutional prohibition against governmental establishment of religion. For example, </em><br/>
<em>they must avoid the actual or apparent use of their position to promote their personal religious </em><br/>
<em>beliefs to their subordinates or to extend preferential treatment for any religion…</em><br/>
<em><b> </b></em><br/>
<em><strong>2.12.1</strong>. All Airmen are able to choose to practice their particular religion, or subscribe to no </em><br/>
<em>religious belief at all. You should confidently practice your own beliefs while respecting </em><br/>
<em>others whose viewpoints differ from your own. </em></p>
<p>A document exhorting individuals to ‘confidently practice your own beliefs while respecting others whose viewpoints differ from you own’ is hardly indicative of the downfall of western civilisation.  Unless, of course, you don’t <em>want</em> to respect others.  Perhaps you genuinely feel that you <em>should</em> be allowed to use a position of authority to extend preferential treatment to adherents of one particular sect.  Perhaps you feel that the government <em>should</em> be in the business of picking and choosing creeds.  Perhaps you <em>want</em> your government be the official arbiter of acceptable belief, practice and religous affiliation in your country.  After all, we already have examples of how <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_for_the_Promotion_of_Virtue_and_the_Prevention_of_Vice_(Saudi_Arabia)">well</a> that works.</p>
<p>But if you are such a person, frankly you concern me far more than a well-written HR document outlining the principles of freedom of conscience and respectfulness towards others.</p>
