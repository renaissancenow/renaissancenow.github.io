<p>My brain gangs up on me sometimes.  I was trying to add some entries to iCal yesterday, and found out that you can’t have a Reminder List that has the same name as a Calendar.  A normal person would have accepted this and moved on.</p>
<p>I have to spend twenty minutes trying to mentally reverse engineer the data model in my head, figure out the design process the engineers at Apple used to come up with this system, and then start delving through .plist files in my /Library directory to see if I’m right.</p>
<p>This is why productivity software doesn’t make me more productive.</p>
