<p>The last few months have been a tough time for internet security.</p>
<p>Recently, we’ve learned that a major computer manufacturer was found last week to be <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/02/19/superfish_lenovo_spyware/">shipping laptops with malware and fake root certificates</a>, compromising the secure communications of their customers.</p>
<div>
<div>We learned that hackers <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2015/02/bank-security-is-so-bad-that-a-simple-phishing-scam-can-cost-us1-billion/">stole hundreds of millions of dollars</a> from Russian banks.</div>
<div></div>
</div>
<div>And we learned that intelligence agencies may have <a href="http://m.bbc.com/news/technology-31545050">hacked</a> into a major SIM card manufacturer, putting the privacy of millions of people at risk.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Those of us in the IT world have a duty to respond to these incidents.</div>
<div></div>
<div>And I use the word <em>duty</em> very intentionally.  Most system administrators have, by nature of their work, a moral, ethical, contractual and legal obligation to protect client and company data.</div>
<p>For example, if they work for a law firm, then the Canadian Bar Association <a href="http://www.cba.org/cba/activities/pdf/codeofconduct.pdf">Code of Professional Conduct</a> includes this section:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<div><b>Maintaining Information in Confidence</b></div>
<div>1. The lawyer has a duty to hold in strict confidence all information concerning the business and affairs of the client acquired in the course of the professional relationship, and shall not divulge any such information except as expressly or impliedly authorized by the client, required by law or otherwise required by this Code.</div>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<div>To ‘hold information in strict confidence’, <em>must</em> apply every bit as much to electronic records and communications as any other type of information.</div>
<div>
<p>If you work for a company with a presence in Europe, you are bound by <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/">EU data legislation</a>, which includes:</p>
</div>
<div>
<blockquote><p><b>“Everyone has the right to the protection of personal data.”</b><br/>
Under EU law, personal data can only be gathered legally under strict conditions, for a legitimate purpose. Furthermore, persons or organisations which collect and manage your personal information must protect it from misuse and must respect certain rights of the data owners which are guaranteed by EU law.</p></blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p> </p>
<p>In my career, I’ve often found myself working with health care data, and thus come under the jurisdiction of Ontario’s <a href="http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_04p03_e.htm#BK13">Personal Health Information Protection Act</a>, which among other things states:</p>
<blockquote><p><b><a href="http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/french/elaws_statutes_04p03_f.htm#s12s1">12.  </a></b><a href="http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/french/elaws_statutes_04p03_f.htm#s12s1">(1)</a>  A health information custodian shall take steps that are reasonable in the circumstances to ensure that personal health information in the custodian’s custody or control is protected against theft, loss and unauthorized use or disclosure and to ensure that the records containing the information are protected against unauthorized copying, modification or disposal.</p></blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>And anyone working in the financial industry is likely to find themselves subject to a Code of Ethics such as <a href="https://www.td.com/document/PDF/governance/td-governance-code-ethics.pdf">this one from TD bank</a>:</div>
<div>
<blockquote>
<div><em>A. Protecting Customer Information</em></div>
<div>Customer information must be kept private and confidential.”</div>
<div></div>
<div><em>C. Protecting TD Information</em> We must carefully protect the confidential and proprietary information to which we have access, and not disclose it to anyone outside of TD or use it without proper authorization, and then only for the proper performance of our duties. “</div>
<div></div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<h2>Nothing to Hide?</h2>
<div>Occasionally, I’ve heard the suggestion that ‘those with nothing to fear have nothing to hide.’</div>
<div></div>
<div>In the light of these duties and obligations, this claim is, of course, absurd.  Not only do we in the IT industry have access and responsibility to large amounts of confidential information, we have a <em>moral, ethical, contractual</em> and <em>legal</em> obligation to keep it secure – to ‘hide’ it.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Because we can’t divine intent when our systems come under attack.  Whether it’s a criminal gang, a careless vendor, or a foreign intelligence agency, the attack vectors are the same, and our response must be the same: robustly and diligently protecting the systems and data that have been placed in our care.</div>
