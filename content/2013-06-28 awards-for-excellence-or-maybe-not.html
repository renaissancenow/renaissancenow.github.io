<p>In 2006 <em>Euromoney</em> magazine published it’s annual list of best banks.</p>
<p>In the North American category, <a href="http://www.euromoney.com/Article/1042204/Title.html">the awards for both Best Investment Bank and Best at Risk Management</a> went to … Bear Stearns.</p>
<p><a class="thumbnail" href="/images/2013/06/450px-BearStearns.jpg"><span id="more-925"></span><br class="Apple-interchange-newline"/><img alt="450px-BearStearns" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-926" height="300" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" src="/images/2013/06/450px-BearStearns-225x300.jpg" srcset="/images/2013/06/450px-BearStearns-225x300.jpg 225w, /images/2013/06/450px-BearStearns.jpg 450w" width="225"/></a></p>
<p>When the awards were issued, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_Stearns">Bear Stearns</a> was already dangerously exposed to toxic debt, and shortly afterwards collapsed, nearly bringing the global financial system down with it.</p>
<p>When it comes to finance and economics, it’s hard to trust that even the experts know what they are talking about.</p>
