<p>Yes, it’s that time of year again, when magazines and websites are full of articles about New Year’s Resolutions.</p>
<p>Actually, I quite like this tradition.  While I’m only too aware of the low success rate of resolutions, I think the turn of the year is an excellent time to stop, take stock of your life, and plan ahead for the coming months.</p>
<p>I have some specific practices that I find extremely helpful in this exercise that I’ll be sharing on Sunday at <a href="http://voxalliance.ca/">Vox Alliance</a>, but in the meantime, I’m interested in hearing from you.  Do you make resolutions? Do you stick to them?  What resolutions do you make?  And what are you looking forward to in 2014?</p>
