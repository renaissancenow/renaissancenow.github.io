<p>Very good article at the New York Times on the ‘Busy’ Trap.</p>
<blockquote><p>I also feel that four or five hours is enough to earn my stay on the planet for one more day. On the best ordinary days of my life, I write in the morning, go for a long bike ride and run errands in the afternoon, and in the evening I see friends, read or watch a movie. This, it seems to me, is a sane and pleasant pace for a day.</p></blockquote>
