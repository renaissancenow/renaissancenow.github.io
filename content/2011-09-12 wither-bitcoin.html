<p><a href="http://bitcoin.org/">Bitcoin</a> is possibly the most interesting and game-changing technology to have been created in the last 10 years.  I think that there is a real possibility that it will succeed where other alternative currencies have failed.</p>
<p>What’s interesting me at the moment is what the path of adoption will be.  Until recently I assumed that the early adopters would all be geeks: people wanting to buy and sell virtual goods, World of Warcraft weaponry, or technical services such as programming and graphical design.</p>
<p>Now that I’m more familiar with the various bitcoin exchanges I wonder whether the currency is more likely to find early use as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market">Forex</a> tool.  It’s very easy to transfer money from a source currency to bitcoin to a target currency, and transferring bitcoins around the world doesn’t require middlemen, fees, or regulation.</p>
<p>We’re obviously a long way from being able to buy a coffee at Tim Hortons with a cryptocurrency, but I think that eventually a healthy market may well emerge, with a large number of goods and services being traded for bitcoin.  I shall be following developments with interest.</p>
